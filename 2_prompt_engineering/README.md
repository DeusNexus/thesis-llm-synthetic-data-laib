# Prompt Engineering

### Info

The prompt engineering does not include any scripts since these are manually defined prompts in accordance with the prompt method.

These were obtained through small experimental runs and worked best. The explicit declaration to return an array helped to reduce the amount of lazy code reponses (e.g. where no synthetic data rows were printed).

Note: In no model any code interpreter were present or used, all of the generated responses solely were generated with the large language models and no use of any external coding enviroments.
