# Result Analysis

### Info

#### Run Jupyter Notebooks

The first analysis is focused on how well the large language models are able to reproduce the request to generate 25 synthetic sample rows in each response.
In the `response_analysis.ipynb` the results are made visible.

The second analysis focuses on the actual row data itself, how well do these synthetic samples compare to the original data.
This can be seen in the `synthetic_analysis.ipynb` file.
