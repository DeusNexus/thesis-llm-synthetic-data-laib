Critically evaluate them and identify improvements. Apply the improvements and generate revised data points. Repeat this process for refined results until you have 25 new data points. The final output should be a complete array of 25 samples, each with the following features: target_material, target_thickness, pulse_width, energy, spot_size, intensity, power, and cutoff_energy. Explicitly show all of the 25 generated samples inside an array.\"}]\n",

generate a set of data points. Critically evaluate them and identify improvements. Apply the improvements and generate revised data points. Repeat this process for refined results until you have 25 new data points. The final output should be a complete array of 25 samples, each with the following features: target_material, target_thickness, pulse_width, energy, spot_size, intensity, power, and cutoff_energy.
