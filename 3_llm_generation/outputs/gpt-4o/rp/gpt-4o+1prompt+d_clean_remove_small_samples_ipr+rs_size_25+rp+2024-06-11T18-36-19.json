Below is the step-by-step methodology for generating 25 new synthetic data points with step-by-step elucidation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Methodology\n\n1. **Generate `cutoff_energy`** within its specified range and statistics.\n2. **Determine `energy`** based on the correlation with `cutoff_energy`.\n3. **Calculate `power`** from the relationship with `energy`.\n4. **Calculate `intensity`** using the relationship with `power` and `spot_size`.\n5. **Choose `spot_size`** to keep it within the given distribution.\n6. **Set `pulse_width`** influenced by `energy`.\n7. **Determine the `target_thickness`** based on its correlation with `energy`.\n8. **Pick `target_material`** based on typical materials used and their statistical appearance in the provided data. \n\nAssumptions:\n- Normally distribute data within ranges and adhere to statistical quantiles provided.\n- Use correlations to ensure a cohesive dataset.\n\n### One Sample Walkthrough:\n1. `cutoff_energy` = 6.2 (a typical value around the 75th percentile)\n2. From the high correlation (0.672), let's assume the `energy` is 2.4.
