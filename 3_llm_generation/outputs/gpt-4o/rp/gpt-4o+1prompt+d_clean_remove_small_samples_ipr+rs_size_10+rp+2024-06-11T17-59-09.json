Below are the calculated statistics for each feature:\n\n- Target Thickness\n  - Mean: 1.02\n  - Median: 0.593\n  - Variance: 16.9\n  - 10th Percentile (Q10): 0.273\n  - 25th Percentile (Q25): 0.482\n  - 75th Percentile (Q75): 0.769\n  - 90th Percentile (Q90): 1.0\n  - Min: 0\n  - Max: 125\n\n- Pulse Width\n  - Mean: 291\n  - Median: 30\n  - Variance: 1,030,000\n  - 10th Percentile (Q10): 30\n  - 25th Percentile (Q25): 30\n  - 75th Percentile (Q75): 279\n  - 90th Percentile (Q90): 475\n  - Min: 24\n  - Max: 12,900\n\n- Energy\n  - Mean: 13.9\n  - Median: 2.35\n  - Variance: 2,350\n  - 10th Percentile (Q10): 1.55\n  - 25th Percentile (Q25): 2.31\n  - 75th Percentile (Q75): 2.41\n  - 90th Percentile (Q90): 10\n  - Min: 0.302\n  - Max: 1,000\n\n- Spot Size\n  - Mean: 3.61\n  - Median: 3.3\n  - Variance: 13.7\n  - 10th Percentile (Q10): 3.3\n  - 25th Percentile (Q25): 3.3\n  - 75th Percentile (Q75): 3.3\n  - 90th Percentile (Q90): 3.3\n  - Min: 2.13\n  - Max: 60\n\n- Intensity\n  - Mean: 5.10e20\n  - Median: 6.22e20\n  - Variance: 3.96e41\n  - 10th Percentile (Q10): 4.53e19\n  - 25th Percentile (Q25): 6.83e19\n  - 75th Percentile (Q75): 6.44e20\n  - 90th Percentile (Q90): 6.59e20\n  - Min: 1.05e18\n  - Max: 5.59e21\n\n- Power\n  - Mean: 6.23e13\n  - Median: 7.68e13\n  - Variance: 4.03e27\n  - 10th Percentile (Q10): 5.59e12\n  - 25th Percentile (Q25): 8.45e12\n  - 75th Percentile (Q75): 7.94e13\n  - 90th Percentile (Q90): 8.14e13\n  - Min: 1.76e11\n  - Max: 3.83e14\n\n- Cutoff Energy\n  - Mean: 8.64\n  - Median: 4.8\n  - Variance: 156\n  - 10th Percentile (Q10): 4.0\n  - 25th Percentile (Q25): 4.4\n  - 75th Percentile (Q75): 6.2\n  - 90th Percentile (Q90): 11.7\n  - Min: 3.3\n  - Max: 95\n\n### Bivariate Statistics\nBelow are the calculated bivariate statistics for pairs of features:\n\n#### Target Thickness and Energy\n- Pearson Correlation: 0.250\n- Spearman Correlation: 0.391\n- Covariance: 4.98e1\n\n#### Pulse Width and Energy\n- Pearson Correlation: 0.343\n- Spearman Correlation: 0.150\n- Covariance: 1.69e4\n\n#### Spot Size and Energy\n- Pearson Correlation: 0.646\n- Spearman Correlation: -0.00389\n- Covariance: 1.16e2\n\n#### Intensity and Energy\n- Pearson Correlation: 0.397\n- Spearman Correlation: 0.567\n- Covariance: 1.21e22\n\n#### Power and Energy\n- Pearson Correlation: 0.584\n- Spearman Correlation: 0.609\n- Covariance: 1.80e15\n\n#### Cutoff Energy and Energy\n- Pearson Correlation: 0.672\n- Spearman Correlation: 0.563\n- Covariance: 4.07e2\n\n\n### Example Data Points\n[\"plastic\", 0.627, 30, 2.394, 3.3, 6.470E+20, 79790000000000, 3.7]\n[\"aluminium\", 5.0, 30, 6.0, 8.0, 2.759E+20, 200000000000000, 10.0]\n[\"polypropylene\", 10.0, 500, 132.03, 4.348, 1.233E+21, 264100000000000, 40.0]\n[\"polystyrene\", 0.3, 500, 128.79, 3.495, 1.862E+21, 257600000000000, 80.0]\n[\"plastic\", 0.769, 30, 2.4, 3.3, 6.487E+20, 80010000000000, 4.0]\n[\"gold\", 4.0, 4600, 22.275, 3.202, 4.170E+19, 4842000000000, 7.2]\n[\"plastic\", 0.913, 279, 2.358, 3.3, 6.853E+19, 8452000000000, 5.4]\n[\"plastic\", 0.998, 30, 2.327, 3.3, 6.288E+20, 77560000000000, 6.2]\n[\"plastic\", 0.44, 463, 2.371, 3.3, 4.153E+19, 5121000000000, 4.4]\n[\"plastic\", 0.294, 30, 2.319, 3.3, 6.266E+20, 77280000000000, 4.4]\n\nStarting with cutoff_energy, determine the necessary intensity and power. Next, decide on spot_size, energy, and pulse_width. Finally, choose appropriate target_thickness and target_material. Generate 25 new data points by reversing the process. The final output should be a complete array of 25 samples, each with the following features: target_material, target_thickness, pulse_width, energy, spot_size, intensity, power, and cutoff_energy. Explicitly show all of the 25 generated samples inside an array."
