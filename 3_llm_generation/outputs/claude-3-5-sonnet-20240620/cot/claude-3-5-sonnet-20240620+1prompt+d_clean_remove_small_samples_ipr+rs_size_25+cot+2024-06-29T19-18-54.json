Target Material: The most common material is plastic, with some occurrences of other materials. We'll maintain a similar distribution.\n\n2. Target Thickness: It's heavily skewed, with most values below 1. We'll use a log-normal distribution to generate values.\n\n3. Pulse Width: There are distinct clusters around 30, 80, 279, and 500. We'll randomly select from these clusters with some variation.\n\n4. Energy: It's correlated with pulse width and has a skewed distribution. We'll use the correlation to inform our generation.\n\n5. Spot Size: Most values are 3.3, with occasional larger values. We'll mostly use 3.3 with some outliers.\n\n6. Intensity and Power: These are highly correlated with energy. We'll use the relationships to generate consistent values.\n\n7. Cutoff Energy: This is correlated with energy.
