Target Material: The most common material is plastic, with some instances of aluminium, polypropylene, gold, and polystyrene. We'll maintain a similar distribution.\n\n2. Target Thickness: This is right-skewed with most values between 0.2 and 1.0. We'll use a log-normal distribution to generate values.\n\n3. Pulse Width: This is highly skewed with common values at 30, 80, 279, and 500. We'll use a discrete distribution based on these common values.\n\n4. Energy: This is right-skewed and somewhat correlated with pulse width. We'll use a log-normal distribution and adjust based on pulse width.\n\n5. Spot Size: Most values are 3.3, with some outliers. We'll use 3.3 for most cases with occasional larger values.\n\n6. Intensity and Power: These are highly correlated. We'll generate intensity using a log-normal distribution and calculate power based on it.\n\n7. Cutoff Energy: This is correlated with energy and intensity.
