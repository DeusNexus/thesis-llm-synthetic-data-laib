Determine the relationship between pulse_width and energy\n3. Investigate the influence of intensity and power on cutoff_energy\n4. Generate new samples based on the observed patterns\n\nStep 1: Analyze unique target materials and frequencies\nFrom the example data, the unique target materials are:\n- plastic (5 instances)\n- aluminium (1 instance) \n- polypropylene (1 instance)\n- polystyrene (1 instance)\n- gold (1 instance)\n\nStep 2: Determine the relationship between pulse_width and energy\nFrom the bivariate statistics, pulse_width and energy have a moderate positive Pearson correlation of 0.343. This suggests that as pulse_width increases, energy also tends to increase.\n\nStep 3: Investigate the influence of intensity and power on cutoff_energy\nThe bivariate statistics show that both intensity and power have moderate to strong positive correlations with cutoff_energy (0.397 and 0.584 respectively). This indicates that higher intensity and power values are associated with higher cutoff_energy values.\n\nStep 4: Generate new samples based on observed patterns\nTo generate the new samples, I will:\n- Select target materials based on their frequencies in the example data\n- Generate pulse_width and energy values that exhibit a positive correlation\n- Compute intensity and power values that lead to reasonable cutoff_energy values\n\nHere are the 25 generated samples:\n\ngenerated_samples = [\n    [\"plastic\", 0.51, 45, 2.8, 3.3, 6.9e20, 8.5e13, 5.1],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.62, 60, 3.5, 3.3, 7.2e20, 8.9e13, 6.0],\n    [\"aluminium\", 2.5, 120, 8.0, 5.0, 3.5e20, 4.3e13, 12.0],\n    [\"polypropylene\", 8.0, 400, 100.0, 4.2, 1.1e21, 2.4e14, 35.0],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.35, 30, 2.2, 3.3, 6.0e20, 7.4e13, 4.2],\n    [\"polystyrene\", 0.6, 600, 150.0, 3.6, 2.0e21, 3.0e14, 90.0],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.75, 90, 4.5, 3.3, 7.5e20, 9.3e13, 7.0],\n    [\"gold\", 3.0, 3000, 15.0, 3.0, 3.0e20, 3.7e13, 6.5],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.45, 50, 3.0, 3.3, 7.0e20, 8.6e13, 5.5],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.55, 70, 4.0, 3.3, 7.3e20, 9.0e13, 6.5],\n    [\"aluminium\", 3.5, 180, 10.0, 6.0, 4.0e20, 4.9e13, 14.0],\n    [\"polypropylene\", 6.0, 350, 80.0, 4.0, 1.0e21, 2.2e14, 30.0],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.40, 40, 2.5, 3.3, 6.5e20, 8.0e13, 4.8],\n    [\"polystyrene\", 0.8, 700, 170.0, 3.8, 2.2e21, 3.3e14, 95.0],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.65, 80, 4.2, 3.3, 7.4e20, 9.1e13, 6.8],\n    [\"gold\", 4.5, 4000, 20.0, 3.5, 4.0e20, 4.9e13, 8.0],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.48, 55, 3.2, 3.3, 7.1e20, 8.8e13, 5.8],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.58, 75, 4.1, 3.3, 7.3e20, 9.0e13, 6.6],\n    [\"aluminium\", 4.0, 200, 12.0, 7.0, 4.5e20, 5.5e13, 16.0],\n    [\"polypropylene\", 7.0, 380, 90.0, 4.1, 1.1e21, 2.5e14, 32.0],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.43, 42, 2.6, 3.3, 6.6e20, 8.1e13, 5.0],\n    [\"polystyrene\", 0.7, 650, 160.0, 3.7, 2.1e21, 3.2e14, 92.0],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.70, 85, 4.3, 3.3, 7.4e20, 9.2e13, 7.2],\n    [\"gold\", 5.0, 4500, 25.0, 4.0, 5.0e20, 6.2e13, 9.0],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.52, 60, 3.4, 3.3, 7.2e20, 8.9e13, 6.2]\n]\n\nThis array of 25 samples captures the key patterns observed in the data, such as the frequencies of target materials, the positive correlation between pulse_width and energy, and the influence of intensity and power on cutoff_energy values.",
