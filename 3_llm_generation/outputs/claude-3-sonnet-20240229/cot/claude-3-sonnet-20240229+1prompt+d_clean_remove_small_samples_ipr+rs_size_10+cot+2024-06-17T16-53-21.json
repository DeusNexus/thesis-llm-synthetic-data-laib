Analyze the target_material values and generate new ones based on the observed frequencies.\n2. Model the relationship between pulse_width and energy using a regression model.\n3.

Generate new values for target_thickness, spot_size, intensity, and power based on their distributions.\n5. Combine all the generated values into a final array of 25 samples.\n\nStep 1: Analyze target_material values\nFrom the example data, we can see that the target_material values are: plastic (5 occurrences), aluminium (1 occurrence), polypropylene (1 occurrence), polystyrene (1 occurrence), and gold (1 occurrence).\n\nLet's assume the following probabilities for generating new target_material values:\n- plastic: 0.5\n- aluminium: 0.2\n- polypropylene: 0.1\n- polystyrene: 0.1\n- gold: 0.1\n\nStep 2: Model the relationship between pulse_width and energy\nWe can use a linear regression model to capture the relationship between pulse_width and energy.
