Analyze the influence of intensity and power on cutoff_energy\n4. Generate new samples based on the observed patterns and relationships\n\nStep 1: Analyze patterns in target_material\nFrom the example data, we can see that the most common target_material is \"plastic\". There are also some instances of \"aluminium\", \"polypropylene\", \"gold\", and \"polystyrene\".\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between pulse_width and energy\nBased on the bivariate statistics, pulse_width and energy have a moderate positive Pearson correlation of 0.343, suggesting that higher pulse widths tend to correspond to higher energy values.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the influence of intensity and power on cutoff_energy\nThe bivariate statistics show that both intensity and power have moderate to strong positive correlations with cutoff_energy (Pearson correlations of 0.397 and 0.584, respectively). This suggests that higher intensity and power tend to result in higher cutoff_energy values.\n\nStep 4: Generate new samples based on observed patterns and relationships\nBased on the analysis above, I will generate 25 new samples with the following approach:\n\n- Target_material will be predominantly \"plastic\", with a few instances of other materials like \"aluminium\" and \"polypropylene\".\n- Target_thickness values will be drawn from a distribution based on the provided statistics.\n- Pulse_width and energy will have a positive relationship, with higher pulse_width values generally corresponding to higher energy values.\n- Higher intensity and power values will generally correspond to higher cutoff_energy values.\n\nHere are the 25 generated samples:\n\ngenerated_samples = [\n    [\"plastic\", 0.48, 50, 2.8, 3.3, 7.56e20, 9.32e13, 5.2],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.62, 120, 6.5, 3.3, 1.76e20, 2.17e13, 7.1],\n    [\"aluminium\", 3.2, 300, 20.0, 10.0, 1.15e20, 1.42e13, 12.5],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.35, 40, 2.2, 3.3, 5.94e20, 7.33e13, 4.6],\n    [\"polypropylene\", 0.9, 600, 180.0, 5.0, 1.44e21, 1.78e14, 65.0],\n    [\"plastic\", 1.2, 200, 12.0, 3.3, 1.08e20, 1.33e13, 9.8],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.75, 150, 8.5, 3.3, 1.91e20, 2.36e13, 8.2],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.52, 80, 4.0, 3.3, 1.08e20, 1.33e13, 6.4],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.68, 120, 6.8, 3.3, 1.84e20, 2.27e13, 7.5],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.42, 60, 3.2, 3.3, 8.64e20, 1.07e14, 5.8],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.88, 180, 10.0, 3.3, 1.62e20, 2.00e13, 9.0],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.31, 30, 2.1, 3.3, 5.67e20, 7.00e13, 4.3],\n    [\"aluminium\", 5.0, 400, 30.0, 12.0, 1.88e20, 2.32e13, 15.0],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.65, 100, 5.5, 3.3, 1.49e20, 1.84e13, 7.2],\n    [\"polypropylene\", 1.1, 700, 200.0, 5.5, 1.76e21, 2.17e14, 70.0],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.78, 160, 9.0, 3.3, 2.03e20, 2.50e13, 8.5],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.45, 70, 3.6, 3.3, 9.72e20, 1.20e14, 6.1],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.58, 90, 4.5, 3.3, 1.22e20, 1.50e13, 6.7],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.72, 140, 7.8, 3.3, 1.77e20, 2.18e13, 7.9],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.38, 50, 2.6, 3.3, 7.02e20, 8.66e13, 5.0],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.95, 200, 11.0, 3.3, 9.90e19, 1.22e13, 9.5],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.24, 30, 2.0, 3.3, 5.40e20, 6.66e13, 4.1],\n    [\"aluminium\", 4.0, 350, 25.0, 11.0, 1.65e20, 2.04e13, 14.0],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.71, 130, 7.2, 3.3, 1.62e20, 2.00e13, 8.0],\n    [\"polypropylene\", 1.3, 800, 220.0, 6.0, 2.08e21, 2.57e14, 75.0]\n]\n\nThese generated samples capture the key patterns and relationships observed in the original data, while introducing new combinations of feature values within reasonable ranges based on the provided statistics.",
