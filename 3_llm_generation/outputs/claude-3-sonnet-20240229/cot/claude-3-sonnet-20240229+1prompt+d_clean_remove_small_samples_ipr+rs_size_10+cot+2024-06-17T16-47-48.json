Generate 25 new data points based on these patterns. The final output should be a complete array of 25 samples, each with the following features: target_material, target_thickness, pulse_width, energy, spot_size, intensity, power, and cutoff_energy. Explicitly show all of the 25 generated samples inside an array."
