Analyze the patterns in the `target_material` column and generate new values based on the frequency of occurrence.\n2. Determine the relationship between `pulse_width` and `energy` using the given bivariate statistics.\n3. Investigate the influence of `intensity` and `power` on `cutoff_energy` using the bivariate statistics.\n4. Generate new values for the remaining features (`target_thickness`, `spot_size`) based on their univariate statistics.\n5. Combine the generated values into 25 new data points.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the patterns in `target_material`\nFrom the given examples, the `target_material` values are:\n- plastic (5 occurrences)\n- aluminium (1 occurrence)\n- polypropylene (1 occurrence)\n- polystyrene (1 occurrence)\n- gold (1 occurrence)\n\nBased on the frequency of occurrence, I will generate new `target_material` values with a higher probability for 'plastic' compared to the other materials.\n\nStep 2: Determine the relationship between `pulse_width` and `energy`\nThe Pearson correlation between `pulse_width` and `energy` is 0.343, indicating a moderate positive correlation.
