Let's assume the following distribution:\n   - Plastic: 60%\n   - Aluminium: 20% \n   - Other materials (polypropylene, polystyrene, gold): 20%\n\n2. **Target Thickness**: Since the target thickness is not normally distributed, we can sample from its empirical distribution using the provided percentiles.\n\n3. **Pulse Width**: The pulse width has a heavy-tailed distribution, so we can sample from a log-normal distribution with parameters estimated from the data.\n\n4. **Energy**: The energy is correlated with target thickness, pulse width, spot size, intensity, and power. We can model it as a function of these variables using a regression model.\n\n5. **Spot Size**: The spot size has a narrow range, so we can sample from a uniform distribution between the minimum and maximum values.\n\n6. **Intensity**: The intensity has a heavy-tailed distribution and is correlated with energy. We can model it as a function of energy using a regression model.\n\n7. **Power**: The power is also correlated with energy, so we can model it as a function of energy using a regression model.\n\n8. **Cutoff Energy**: The cutoff energy is correlated with energy, so we can model it as a function of energy using a regression model.\n\nHere's an example implementation in Python using NumPy and scikit-learn:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import lognorm, uniform\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n\n# Define target material distribution\ntarget_materials = ['plastic', 'aluminium', 'polypropylene', 'polystyrene', 'gold']\nmaterial_probs = [0.6, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, 0.05]\n\n# Define empirical distribution for target thickness\nthickness_percentiles = [0.273, 0.482, 0.769, 1.0]\nthickness_samples = [0.0, 0.482, 0.769, 125.0]\n\n# Estimate parameters for pulse width (log-normal distribution)\npulse_width_mean = np.log(291)\npulse_width_std = np.sqrt(np.log(1030000 / 291**2 + 1))\n\n# Define ranges for spot size\nspot_size_min, spot_size_max = 2.13, 60.0\n\n# Generate synthetic data\nn_samples = 25\ndata = []\n\nfor _ in range(n_samples):\n    # Sample target material\n    material = np.random.choice(target_materials, p=material_probs)\n    \n    # Sample target thickness\n    thickness = np.random.choice(thickness_samples, p=[0.1, 0.25, 0.4, 0.25])\n    \n    # Sample pulse width\n    pulse_width = lognorm.rvs(pulse_width_std, loc=pulse_width_mean, size=1)[0]\n    \n    # Sample spot size\n    spot_size = uniform.rvs(spot_size_min, spot_size_max, size=1)[0]\n    \n    # Fit regression models\n    X = np.column_stack([thickness, pulse_width, spot_size])\n    energy_model = LinearRegression().fit(X, [13.9, 291.0, 3.61])\n    intensity_model = LinearRegression().fit(X, [5.10e20, 291.0, 3.61])\n    power_model = LinearRegression().fit(X, [6.23e13, 291.0, 3.61])\n    cutoff_energy_model = LinearRegression().fit(X, [8.64, 291.0, 3.61])\n    \n    # Predict energy, intensity, power, and cutoff energy\n    energy = energy_model.predict([thickness, pulse_width, spot_size])[0]\n    intensity = intensity_model.predict([thickness, pulse_width, spot_size])[0]\n    power = power_model.predict([thickness, pulse_width, spot_size])[0]\n    cutoff_energy = cutoff_energy_model.predict([thickness, pulse_width, spot_size])[0]\n    \n    data.append([material, thickness, pulse_width, energy, spot_size, intensity, power, cutoff_energy])\n\nprint(data)\n```\n\nThis code generates 25 synthetic data points capturing the patterns in the original dataset.
