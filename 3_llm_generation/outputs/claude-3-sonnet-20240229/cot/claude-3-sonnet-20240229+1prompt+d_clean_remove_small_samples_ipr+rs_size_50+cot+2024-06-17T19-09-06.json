The majority of the data points are for \"plastic\" targets.\n\n2. **Target Thickness:** The target thickness distribution is heavily right-skewed, with most values concentrated around the lower end of the range (0 to 1.0).\n\n3. **Pulse Width:** Most of the data points have pulse widths of either 30 fs or around 279-500 fs, with a few outliers at higher values.\n\n4. **Energy:** The energy distribution is also right-skewed, with a concentration of values around 2-3 J. Higher energy values are generally associated with longer pulse widths.\n\n5. **Spot Size:** The spot size is relatively constant across the data, with most values around 3.3 \u03bcm.\n\n6. **Intensity:** The intensity distribution is heavily right-skewed, spanning a wide range of values from 10^18 to 10^21 W/cm^2.\n\n7. **Power:** Power is positively correlated with energy and pulse width, and the distribution is also right-skewed.\n\n8. **Cutoff Energy:** Cutoff energy is positively correlated with energy, intensity, and power.
