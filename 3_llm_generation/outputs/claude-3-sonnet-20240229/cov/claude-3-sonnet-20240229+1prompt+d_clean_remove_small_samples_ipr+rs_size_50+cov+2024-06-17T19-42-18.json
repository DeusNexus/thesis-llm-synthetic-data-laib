The final output will be an array of 25 samples, each containing the following features: target_material, target_thickness, pulse_width, energy, spot_size, intensity, power, and cutoff_energy.\n\nStep 1: Select target_material and verify its distribution.\nThe provided examples suggest that the target_material can be one of the following: \"aluminium\", \"gold\", \"plastic\", \"polypropylene\", or \"polystyrene\". For this synthetic dataset, I will randomly select from these options with equal probability.\n\nStep 2: Choose target_thickness within realistic ranges.\nBased on the provided statistics, the target_thickness has a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 125. The mean is 1.02, and the median is 0.593. To generate realistic values, I will randomly sample from a right-skewed distribution within the provided range.\n\nStep 3: Determine pulse_width and verify its correlation with energy.\nThe pulse_width has a minimum of 24, a maximum of 12,900, and a median of 30. The examples show that pulse_width and energy have a moderate positive correlation (0.343 Pearson correlation). To generate realistic values, I will first randomly sample pulse_width from a right-skewed distribution within the provided range, and then generate energy based on the sampled pulse_width value and their correlation.\n\nStep 4: Adjust spot_size and verify intensity and power.\nThe spot_size has a minimum of 2.13, a maximum of 60, and a median of 3.3. The examples suggest that spot_size and energy have a moderate positive correlation (0.646 Pearson correlation). To generate realistic values, I will first randomly sample spot_size from a distribution within the provided range, and then generate intensity and power based on the sampled spot_size value and its correlation with energy.\n\nStep 5: Calculate cutoff_energy and verify it against the given examples.\nThe cutoff_energy has a minimum of 3.3, a maximum of 95, and a median of 4.8. The examples show that cutoff_energy has a strong positive correlation with energy (0.672 Pearson correlation). To generate realistic values, I will calculate cutoff_energy based on the generated energy value and their correlation.\n\nHere is the array of 25 generated samples:\n\n[\n    [\"plastic\", 0.75, 463, 2.43, 3.3, 4.26e+19, 5.25e+12, 4.8],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.61, 30, 2.31, 3.3, 6.23e+20, 7.68e+13, 5.5],\n    [\"polystyrene\", 0.35, 500, 174.96, 3.1, 3.21e+21, 3.50e+14, 70.0],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.49, 30, 1.53, 3.3, 4.13e+20, 5.10e+13, 4.5],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.92, 279, 2.35, 3.3, 6.86e+19, 8.46e+12, 5.5],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.51, 463, 2.37, 3.3, 4.14e+19, 5.11e+12, 3.8],\n    [\"gold\", 1.1, 500, 54.27, 2.13, 2.12e+21, 1.09e+14, 30.0],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.72, 30, 2.33, 3.3, 6.29e+20, 7.75e+13, 4.8],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.68, 279, 2.34, 3.3, 6.80e+19, 8.39e+12, 4.4],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.27, 30, 2.33, 3.3, 6.30e+20, 7.77e+13, 4.5],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.57, 30, 2.41, 3.3, 6.51e+20, 8.03e+13, 4.3],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.76, 30, 2.42, 3.3, 6.55e+20, 8.08e+13, 4.8],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.78, 279, 2.33, 3.3, 6.77e+19, 8.35e+12, 4.8],\n    [\"aluminium\", 5.0, 1500, 250.0, 60.0, 4.09e+18, 1.67e+11, 13.0],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.85, 279, 2.31, 3.3, 6.71e+19, 8.28e+12, 5.5],\n    [\"plastic\", 1.01, 30, 2.38, 3.3, 6.44e+20, 7.95e+13, 3.7],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.74, 30, 2.39, 3.3, 6.46e+20, 7.97e+13, 4.5],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.57, 30, 2.35, 3.3, 6.34e+20, 7.82e+13, 4.3],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.63, 30, 2.39, 3.3, 6.44e+20, 7.95e+13, 4.4],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.97, 30, 2.39, 3.3, 6.46e+20, 7.97e+13, 6.2],\n    [\"polypropylene\", 0.8, 500, 146.61, 4.41, 1.33e+21, 2.93e+14, 54.5],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.56, 30, 2.37, 3.3, 6.41e+20, 7.90e+13, 5.4],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.27, 30, 1.51, 3.3, 4.09e+20, 5.04e+13, 4.8],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.75, 279, 2.37, 3.3, 6.87e+19, 8.48e+12, 4.5],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.67, 279, 2.38, 3.3, 6.93e+19, 8.54e+12, 4.8]\n]\n\nEach sample in the array follows the format [target_material, target_thickness, pulse_width, energy, spot_size, intensity, power, cutoff_energy].
