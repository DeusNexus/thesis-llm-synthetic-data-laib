Select target_material and verify its distribution.\nThe target_material is a categorical feature, so I will randomly select from a list of common materials used in laser-accelerated ion beam experiments, such as aluminium, gold, polypropylene, and plastic.\n\n2. Choose target_thickness within realistic ranges.\nBased on the given statistics, I will generate target_thickness values from a skewed distribution with a median of 0.593 and a maximum value of 125.\n\n3.

I will generate pulse_width values from a skewed distribution with a median of 30 and a maximum value of 12,900. Then, I will adjust the energy values to maintain the specified correlation.\n\n4. Adjust spot_size and verify intensity and power.\nThe spot_size values will be generated from a distribution with a median of 3.3 and a maximum value of 60. The intensity and power values will be calculated based on the generated energy and spot_size values, ensuring the provided correlations are maintained.\n\n5.
