Select target_material and verify its distribution.\n\nThe target_material feature is categorical and can take values such as \"plastic,\" \"aluminium,\" \"polypropylene,\" \"gold,\" and \"polystyrene.\" For this synthetic dataset, we will assume an equal distribution across these materials.\n\n2. Choose target_thickness within realistic ranges.\n\nAccording to the statistics provided, the target_thickness feature has a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 125. The 10th and 90th percentiles are 0.273 and 1.0, respectively. We will generate target_thickness values randomly within this range, ensuring a reasonable distribution.\n\n3.

We will calculate these values based on the generated values for the other features.\n\n5. Calculate cutoff_energy and verify it against the given examples.\n\nThe cutoff_energy feature has a strong positive correlation with energy (Pearson correlation of 0.672). We will calculate cutoff_energy based on the generated energy values, ensuring a positive correlation and values within the given range (3.3 to 95).\n\nHere are the 25 generated samples, with each sample represented as an array containing the following features: [target_material, target_thickness, pulse_width, energy, spot_size, intensity, power, cutoff_energy]:\n\n[\n    [\"plastic\", 0.487, 128, 3.21, 3.54, 4.24e+19, 52200000000000, 5.12],\n    [\"aluminium\", 2.75, 241, 9.82, 7.63, 1.51e+19, 18600000000000, 11.67],\n    [\"polypropylene\", 0.352, 367, 67.14, 4.21, 5.75e+20, 142300000000000, 32.48],\n    [\"gold\", 1.29, 475, 4.65, 4.77, 3.86e+19, 47600000000000, 9.52],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.619, 175, 4.83, 3.72, 5.15e+19, 63500000000000, 6.89],\n    [\"polystyrene\", 0.874, 500, 135.27, 3.39, 2.24e+21, 270500000000000, 79.14],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.395, 97, 2.68, 3.46, 3.21e+19, 39600000000000, 4.54],\n    [\"aluminium\", 4.16, 312, 12.75, 10.24, 1.43e+19, 17600000000000, 14.23],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.732, 206, 5.67, 3.84, 5.49e+19, 67700000000000, 7.73],\n    [\"polypropylene\", 0.218, 274, 42.38, 3.97, 4.10e+20, 101700000000000, 24.82],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.551, 153, 4.28, 3.66, 4.96e+19, 61200000000000, 6.21],\n    [\"gold\", 2.14, 475, 6.29, 5.35, 3.71e+19, 45700000000000, 11.15],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.683, 190, 5.24, 3.79, 5.15e+19, 63500000000000, 7.18],\n    [\"aluminium\", 3.42, 275, 11.03, 8.84, 1.64e+19, 20200000000000, 12.85],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.459, 118, 3.05, 3.51, 3.87e+19, 47700000000000, 4.91],\n    [\"polypropylene\", 0.291, 324, 56.27, 4.09, 5.12e+20, 127100000000000, 29.17],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.775, 219, 6.02, 3.89, 5.55e+19, 68500000000000, 8.15],\n    [\"gold\", 1.71, 475, 5.48, 5.07, 4.02e+19, 49500000000000, 10.41],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.638, 181, 5.01, 3.75, 5.18e+19, 63900000000000, 7.05],\n    [\"polystyrene\", 1.12, 500, 135.27, 3.48, 2.01e+21, 270500000000000, 75.92],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.413, 104, 2.84, 3.49, 3.34e+19, 41200000000000, 4.69],\n    [\"aluminium\", 4.87, 341, 13.83, 11.28, 1.35e+19, 16600000000000, 15.49],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.572, 162, 4.51, 3.69, 4.95e+19, 61100000000000, 6.47],\n    [\"polypropylene\", 0.165, 237, 35.07, 3.85, 3.68e+20, 91200000000000, 21.06],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.812, 231, 6.39, 3.94, 5.62e+19, 69300000000000, 8.61]\n]",
