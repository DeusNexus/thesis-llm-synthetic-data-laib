    "content": "To generate synthetic data for laser-accelerated ion beams, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. Select target_material and verify its distribution.\n2. Choose target_thickness within realistic ranges.\n3. Determine pulse_width and verify its correlation with energy.\n4. Adjust spot_size and verify intensity and power.\n5. Calculate cutoff_energy and verify it against the given examples.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Select target_material:\nAssume the target materials are limited to [\"aluminium\", \"gold\", \"polypropylene\", \"plastic\"]. Assign equal probability to each material.\n\n2. Choose target_thickness:\nBased on the statistics, generate random values for target_thickness between 0 and 125 microns, ensuring the distribution matches the given median and percentiles.\n\n3. Determine pulse_width and verify its correlation with energy:\nThe correlation between pulse_width and energy is relatively weak (Pearson correlation of 0.343). Generate pulse_width values between 24 and 12,900 femtoseconds, ensuring the distribution matches the given median and percentiles. Then, generate energy values based on the pulse_width values, with some added random noise to account for the weak correlation.\n\n4. Adjust spot_size and verify intensity and power:\nThe spot_size has a relatively narrow range of 2.13 to 60 microns. Generate random values within this range, favoring values closer to the median of 3.3 microns. Calculate intensity and power based on the generated energy and spot_size values, ensuring they fall within the given ranges.\n\n5. Calculate cutoff_energy and verify it against the given examples:\nUse the generated energy values to calculate cutoff_energy, ensuring the distribution matches the given median and percentiles.
