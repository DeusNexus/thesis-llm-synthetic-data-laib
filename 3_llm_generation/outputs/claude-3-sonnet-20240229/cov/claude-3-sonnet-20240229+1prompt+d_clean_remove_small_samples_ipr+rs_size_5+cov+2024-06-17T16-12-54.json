    "content": "To generate synthetic data for laser-accelerated ion beams, I will follow the steps outlined, verifying each step to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. Select target_material and verify its distribution.\n\nThe target_material is a categorical variable, so we cannot directly use the provided statistics. Let's assume an equal distribution across the following materials: \"aluminium\", \"gold\", \"polypropylene\", and \"plastic\".\n\n2. Choose target_thickness within realistic ranges.\n\nThe target_thickness has a non-normal distribution with a median of 0.593, a minimum of 0, and a maximum of 125. We can use the percentile values to generate realistic values. For example, we can sample from a distribution where 25% of the values are below 0.482, 50% are below 0.593, 75% are below 0.769, and 90% are below 1.0.\n\n3. Determine pulse_width and verify its correlation with energy.\n\nThe pulse_width has a non-normal distribution with a median of 30 and a wide range from 24 to 12,900. We can sample from a log-normal distribution to capture the skewness. The provided bivariate statistics show a moderate positive correlation between pulse_width and energy (Pearson correlation of 0.343). We can use this correlation to generate values that are consistent with the observed relationship.\n\n4. Adjust spot_size and verify intensity and power.\n\nThe spot_size has a narrow range from 2.13 to 60, with a median of 3.3. We can sample from a normal distribution centered around 3.3 with a suitable standard deviation. The intensity and power depend on the spot_size, energy, and pulse_width. We can calculate these values using the provided formulas and verify that they fall within the observed ranges.\n\n5. Calculate cutoff_energy and verify it against the given examples.\n\nThe cutoff_energy has a non-normal distribution with a median of 4.8 and a range from 3.3 to 95. We can use the provided bivariate statistics to model the relationship between cutoff_energy and other features, such as energy (Pearson correlation of 0.672). We can then generate cutoff_energy values that are consistent with the observed correlations.\n\nHere is an array of 25 generated samples, each with the following features: target_material, target_thickness, pulse_width, energy, spot_size, intensity, power, and cutoff_energy.\n\n```python\ngenerated_samples = [\n    [\"plastic\", 0.691, 195, 4.65, 3.27, 1.26e+20, 9.08e+12, 5.3],\n    [\"gold\", 0.982, 7000, 35.8, 2.89, 5.49e+19, 2.51e+14, 9.2],\n    [\"polypropylene\", 2.34, 1200, 25.7, 4.02, 2.05e+20, 3.08e+13, 7.8],\n    [\"aluminium\", 0.452, 60, 2.01, 3.35, 5.50e+20, 1.21e+13, 4.6],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.524, 45, 2.12, 3.31, 6.07e+20, 9.52e+12, 4.8],\n    [\"gold\", 1.52, 9500, 47.2, 2.67, 8.76e+19, 4.49e+14, 11.1],\n    [\"polypropylene\", 6.78, 800, 18.9, 3.82, 1.34e+20, 1.51e+13, 6.9],\n    [\"aluminium\", 0.301, 35, 1.64, 3.29, 5.53e+20, 5.74e+12, 4.2],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.635, 180, 4.35, 3.26, 1.17e+20, 7.85e+12, 5.1],\n    [\"gold\", 1.12, 8200, 41.5, 2.78, 6.75e+19, 3.40e+14, 10.2],\n    [\"polypropylene\", 4.21, 1500, 31.2, 3.89, 2.65e+20, 4.68e+13, 8.6],\n    [\"aluminium\", 0.387, 50, 1.89, 3.32, 5.39e+20, 9.45e+12, 4.5],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.583, 65, 2.42, 3.33, 6.55e+20, 1.57e+13, 5.0],\n    [\"gold\", 1.28, 8800, 44.7, 2.72, 7.60e+19, 3.93e+14, 10.7],\n    [\"polypropylene\", 5.34, 1300, 27.9, 3.95, 2.29e+20, 3.62e+13, 8.2],\n    [\"aluminium\", 0.422, 55, 1.95, 3.34, 5.47e+20, 1.07e+13, 4.5],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.609, 75, 2.72, 3.35, 7.36e+20, 2.04e+13, 5.2],\n    [\"gold\", 1.39, 9200, 46.5, 2.69, 8.21e+19, 4.28e+14, 11.0],\n    [\"polypropylene\", 6.12, 900, 21.4, 3.91, 1.78e+20, 1.93e+13, 7.3],\n    [\"aluminium\", 0.375, 48, 1.84, 3.31, 5.36e+20, 8.82e+12, 4.4],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.613, 90, 3.02, 3.37, 8.16e+20, 2.71e+13, 5.4],\n    [\"gold\", 1.47, 9600, 48.5, 2.65, 8.74e+19, 4.65e+14, 11.3],\n    [\"polypropylene\", 6.56, 1000, 23.8, 3.97, 2.06e+20, 2.38e+13, 7.6],\n    [\"aluminium\", 0.342, 42, 1.75, 3.30, 5.28e+20, 7.35e+12, 4.3],\n    [\"plastic\", 0.589, 70, 2.57, 3.34, 6.94e+20, 1.80e+13, 5.1]\n]\n```\n\nThis array contains 25 samples, each with the following features: target_material, target_thickness, pulse_width, energy, spot_size, intensity, power, and cutoff_energy.
