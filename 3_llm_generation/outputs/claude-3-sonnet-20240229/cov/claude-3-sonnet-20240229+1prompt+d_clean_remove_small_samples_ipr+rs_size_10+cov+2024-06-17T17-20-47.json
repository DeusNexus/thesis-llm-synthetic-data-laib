Select target_material and verify its distribution.\nThe target_material is a categorical feature, so we can randomly select from the given examples: [\"plastic\", \"aluminium\", \"polypropylene\", \"polystyrene\", \"gold\"].\n\n2. Choose target_thickness within realistic ranges.\nThe target_thickness has a mean of 1.02, median of 0.593, and a range from 0 to 125. I will generate random values within this range, ensuring that the distribution matches the given statistics.\n\n3. Determine pulse_width and verify its correlation with energy.\nThe pulse_width has a mean of 291, median of 30, and a range from 24 to 12,900. I will generate random values within this range. The correlation with energy (Pearson's r = 0.343) will be maintained by adjusting the pulse_width proportionally to the generated energy values.\n\n4.
