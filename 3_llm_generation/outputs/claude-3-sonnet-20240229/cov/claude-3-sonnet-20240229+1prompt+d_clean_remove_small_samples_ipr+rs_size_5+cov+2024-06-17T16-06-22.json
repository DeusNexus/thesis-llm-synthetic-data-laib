The final output will be an array of 25 samples, where each sample contains the following features: target_material, target_thickness, pulse_width, energy, spot_size, intensity, power, and cutoff_energy.\n\nStep 1: Select target_material and verify its distribution.\nAssuming there are four target materials (aluminium, gold, polypropylene, and plastic), I will randomly select materials from this list.\n\nStep 2: Choose target_thickness within realistic ranges.\nBased on the provided statistics, I will generate target_thickness values within the range of 0 to 125, ensuring that the distribution roughly matches the given statistics (mean: 1.02, median: 0.593, variance: 16.9).\n\nStep 3: Determine pulse_width and verify its correlation with energy.\nThe pulse_width and energy features have a moderate positive correlation (Pearson correlation: 0.343).
