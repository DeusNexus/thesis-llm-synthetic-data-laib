The ranges and distributions of values for each feature have been further refined to better align with realistic experimental conditions and expected patterns.\n\n2. Explicit correlations and dependencies between features have been introduced based on known physical relationships and phenomena. For example:\n   - Higher pulse width and energy values are associated with higher intensity and power values.\n   - Higher target thickness values are associated with higher cutoff energy values for metallic targets.\n   - Lower target thickness values are associated with lower cutoff energy values for plastic targets.\n\n3. Implausible or inconsistent combinations of feature values have been identified and eliminated. For example:\n   - Extremely high or low values for certain features that would be unlikely to occur together have been avoided.\n   - Combinations of target material and cutoff energy that would be physically inconsistent have been eliminated.\n\n4. Additional sources of variation and noise have been introduced to enhance diversity and variability in the data, while maintaining realistic patterns. For example:\n   - Random perturbations have been applied to some feature values to introduce natural variability.\n   - Outliers or extreme values have been included in a controlled manner to represent potential experimental anomalies or measurement errors.\n\nOverall, this final set of 25 samples aims to strike a balance between realism, diversity, and physical consistency, while also exhibiting clear patterns and relationships between the features.",

The ranges and distributions of values for each feature have been further refined to better align with realistic experimental conditions and expected patterns.\n\n2. Explicit correlations and dependencies between features have been introduced based on known physical relationships and phenomena. For example:\n   - Higher pulse width and energy values are associated with higher intensity and power values.\n   - Higher target thickness values are associated with higher cutoff energy values for metallic targets.\n   - Lower target thickness values are associated with lower cutoff energy values for plastic targets.\n\n3. Implausible or inconsistent combinations of feature values have been identified and eliminated. For example:\n   - Extremely high or low values for certain features that would be unlikely to occur together have been avoided.\n   - Combinations of target material and cutoff energy that would be physically inconsistent have been eliminated.\n\n4. Additional sources of variation and noise have been introduced to enhance diversity and variability in the data, while maintaining realistic patterns. For example:\n   - Random perturbations have been applied to some feature values to introduce natural variability.\n   - Outliers or extreme values have been included in a controlled manner to represent potential experimental anomalies or measurement errors.\n\nOverall, this final set of 25 samples aims to strike a balance between realism, diversity, and physical consistency, while also exhibiting clear patterns and relationships between the features.",

Critically evaluate them and identify improvements. Apply the improvements and generate revised data points. Repeat this process for refined results until you have 25 new data points. The final output should be a complete array of 25 samples, each with the following features: target_material, target_thickness, pulse_width, energy, spot_size, intensity, power, and cutoff_energy. Explicitly show all of the 25 generated samples inside an array."
