For the synthetic data, we'll use the following distribution:\n- \"plastic\": 60%\n- \"aluminium\": 15% \n- \"polypropylene\": 10%\n- \"polystyrene\": 10%\n- \"gold\": 5%\n\nStep 2: Consider the relationship between pulse_width and energy\nThe Pearson correlation between pulse_width and energy is 0.343, indicating a moderate positive linear relationship. We'll generate pulse_width values from the given statistics and then calculate the corresponding energy values using a linear regression equation: \nenergy = 0.0001 * pulse_width + 10.83\n\nStep 3: Analyze the influence of intensity and power on cutoff_energy\nThe Pearson correlation between intensity and cutoff_energy is 0.397, and between power and cutoff_energy is 0.584, indicating moderate to strong positive linear relationships.
