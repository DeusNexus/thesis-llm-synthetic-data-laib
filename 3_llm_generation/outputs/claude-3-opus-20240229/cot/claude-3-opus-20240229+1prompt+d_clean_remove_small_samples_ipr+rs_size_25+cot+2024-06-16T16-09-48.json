It appears most samples use plastic, with a few other materials like aluminium, gold, polypropylene and polystyrene. For the synthetic data, I'll use:\n- plastic: 80% (20 samples) \n- aluminium: 8% (2 samples)\n- gold: 4% (1 sample) \n- polypropylene: 4% (1 sample)\n- polystyrene: 4% (1 sample)\n\nStep 2: Note the positive correlation between pulse_width and energy. To mimic this, for each sample:\n- If pulse_width <= 100, energy will be sampled from a normal distribution with mean 2.3 and stdev 0.1  \n- If 100 < pulse_width <= 300, energy will be sampled from a normal distribution with mean 2.0 and stdev 0.5\n- If pulse_width > 300, energy will be sampled from a normal distribution with mean 50 and stdev 50\n\nStep 3: Observe the positive correlations of intensity and power with cutoff_energy. To reproduce this pattern, cutoff_energy will be modeled as:\n- cutoff_energy = 3.0 + 0.8 * log10(intensity) + 0.2 * log10(power) + noise\nwhere noise is normally distributed with mean 0 and stdev 0.3\n\nStep 4: For the remaining features, values will be sampled as follows: \n- target_thickness: Exponentially distributed with mean 1.02\n- pulse_width: 90% chance of 30, 10% chance exponentially distributed with mean 291 \n- spot_size: 90% chance of 3.3, 10% chance uniformly distributed between 3.3 and 20\n- intensity: Lognormally distributed with mean log 20.5 and stdev log 1.5\n- power: intensity * spot_size^2\n\nStep 5: Generate the synthetic data points using the above sampling scheme:\n\n[\n  [\"plastic\", 0.43, 30, 2.28, 3.3, 1.26e+20, 1.37e+13, 5.21], \n  [\"plastic\", 0.22, 30, 2.31, 3.3, 1.63e+21, 1.78e+14, 7.28],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.89, 30, 2.19, 3.3, 4.19e+19, 4.57e+12, 3.91],\n  [\"polypropylene\", 0.37, 500, 127.49, 4.21, 4.84e+20, 8.57e+13, 42.33],\n  [\"plastic\", 1.34, 30, 2.33, 3.3, 6.98e+20, 7.62e+13, 6.42],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.08, 30, 2.21, 3.3, 3.43e+21, 3.74e+14, 7.86],\n  [\"plastic\", 2.71, 30, 2.24, 3.3, 2.79e+20, 3.05e+13, 5.62],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.92, 279, 1.97, 3.3, 8.13e+19, 8.87e+12, 4.77],\n  [\"aluminium\", 3.18, 60, 3.12, 12.4, 1.05e+18, 1.62e+12, 3.35],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.19, 30, 2.40, 3.3, 2.50e+20, 2.73e+13, 5.56],\n  [\"gold\", 1.73, 475, 65.18, 5.1, 6.51e+19, 1.69e+13, 20.79],\n  [\"aluminium\", 2.22, 60, 1.89, 8.7, 5.25e+19, 3.97e+13, 5.43], \n  [\"plastic\", 0.62, 80, 2.44, 3.3, 9.21e+19, 1.01e+13, 5.15],\n  [\"plastic\", 4.39, 30, 2.38, 3.3, 5.59e+21, 6.11e+14, 9.02],\n  [\"plastic\", 1.46, 279, 2.12, 3.3, 9.88e+20, 1.08e+14, 7.09],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.04, 30, 2.20, 3.3, 1.94e+20, 2.12e+13, 5.31],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.28, 30, 2.39, 3.3, 7.37e+19, 8.05e+12, 4.67],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.57, 30, 2.37, 3.3, 3.07e+20, 3.35e+13, 5.84],\n  [\"plastic\", 3.09, 279, 1.74, 3.3, 2.62e+19, 2.86e+12, 4.39],\n  [\"plastic\", 1.16, 279, 1.28, 3.3, 1.41e+21, 1.54e+14, 7.3],\n  [\"polystyrene\", 2.94, 500, 83.57, 4.82, 1.81e+21, 4.2e+14, 49.52],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.33, 30, 2.26, 3.3, 8.31e+20, 9.08e+13, 6.78],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.71, 80, 2.27, 3.3, 3.78e+20, 4.12e+13, 6.06],\n  [\"plastic\", 1.82, 30, 2.43, 3.3, 4.53e+19, 4.94e+12, 4.42],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.11, 30, 2.22, 3.3, 6.01e+20, 6.56e+13, 6.3]\n]\n\nThis synthetic dataset mimics key patterns in the original data while adding some realistic variability.
