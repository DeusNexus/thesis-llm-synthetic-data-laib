    "content": "Here is the step-by-step process to generate 25 new synthetic data points based on the provided statistics and patterns:\n\nStep 1: Target Material\nThe most common target material appears to be plastic, with a few examples of other materials like aluminum, polypropylene, gold, and polystyrene. For the synthetic data, we will generate:\n- 20 samples with plastic\n- 2 samples with aluminum \n- 1 sample each of polypropylene, gold, and polystyrene\n\nStep 2: Pulse Width and Energy\nThere is a moderate positive correlation between pulse width and energy (Pearson correlation 0.343). To reflect this, we will:\n- Generate most samples with pulse widths between the 25th and 75th percentiles (30-279 fs), with corresponding energy values also mostly between the 25th and 75th percentiles (2.31-2.41 J)\n- Generate a few samples with higher pulse widths (>279 fs) and higher energies (>2.41 J)\n- Avoid very high pulse widths (>1000 fs) or very high energies (>20 J) to match the original data\n\nStep 3: Intensity, Power and Cutoff Energy  \nIntensity and power have moderate positive correlations with cutoff energy (Pearson correlations of 0.397 and 0.584 respectively). To capture this:\n- For samples with intensity and power values close to their medians, generate cutoff energies mostly between the 25th and 75th percentiles (4.4-6.2 MeV)\n- For samples with higher intensity and power (>75th percentile), occasionally generate higher cutoff energies (6-12 MeV)\n- Avoid very high cutoff energies (>50 MeV) unlike the real data\n\nStep 4: Other Features\n- For target thickness, spot size, intensity and power, generate most values between the 25th and 75th percentiles, with a few outliers\n- Maintain consistent relationships, e.g. higher power and intensities for shorter pulse widths\n\nStep 5: Generated Samples\n[\n  [\"plastic\", 0.62, 100, 2.38, 3.3, 5.8e20, 7.1e13, 5.2],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.55, 250, 2.34, 3.3, 6.5e19, 8.0e12, 4.7], \n  [\"plastic\", 0.71, 80, 2.41, 3.3, 2.1e20, 2.6e13, 5.8],\n  [\"aluminum\", 4.2, 400, 5.6, 8.0, 2.2e19, 8.8e13, 7.1],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.33, 30, 2.32, 3.3, 6.4e20, 7.9e13, 4.5],\n  [\"polypropylene\", 0.18, 600, 70.5, 4.1, 9.5e20, 1.4e14, 28.6],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.47, 60, 2.36, 3.3, 3.8e20, 4.7e13, 4.2],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.59, 200, 2.39, 3.3, 8.1e19, 1.0e13, 5.5],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.81, 300, 2.28, 3.3, 5.2e19, 6.4e12, 6.0], \n  [\"gold\", 3.5, 450, 3.1, 5.2, 2.6e19, 6.9e13, 8.8],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.76, 100, 2.37, 3.3, 1.9e20, 2.3e13, 5.4],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.64, 180, 2.35, 3.3, 9.3e19, 1.1e13, 5.0],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.28, 30, 2.33, 3.3, 6.3e20, 7.8e13, 3.9],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.92, 320, 1.9, 3.3, 4.8e19, 5.9e12, 6.5],\n  [\"aluminum\", 5.5, 380, 4.5, 10.0, 3.1e19, 1.1e14, 6.8],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.45, 50, 2.29, 3.3, 4.2e20, 5.2e13, 4.6], \n  [\"plastic\", 0.53, 220, 2.4, 3.3, 7.4e19, 9.1e12, 4.9],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.67, 90, 2.31, 3.3, 2.0e20, 2.5e13, 5.3],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.39, 40, 2.3, 3.3, 5.5e20, 6.8e13, 4.4],\n  [\"polystyrene\", 1.2, 550, 100.8, 3.8, 1.4e21, 1.8e14, 55.2],  \n  [\"plastic\", 0.72, 120, 2.34, 3.3, 1.6e20, 2.0e13, 5.9],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.83, 260, 2.25, 3.3, 6.0e19, 7.4e12, 5.7],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.36, 35, 2.32, 3.3, 6.0e20, 7.4e13, 4.3], \n  [\"plastic\", 0.69, 150, 2.38, 3.3, 1.2e20, 1.5e13, 5.1],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.58, 240, 2.42, 3.3, 7.0e19, 8.6e12, 4.8]\n]\n\nThis generated dataset of 25 samples exhibits similar patterns and relationships as the original data, while avoiding extreme outlier values.
