    "content": "Here is the step-by-step process to generate 25 new synthetic data points based on the provided statistics and example data:\n\nStep 1: Analyze target_material distribution\nBased on the example data, the most common target materials appear to be \"plastic\", with a few instances of \"aluminium\", \"polypropylene\", \"gold\", and \"polystyrene\". For the synthetic data, we will primarily use \"plastic\" with a few instances of the other materials.\n\nStep 2: Consider the relationship between pulse_width and energy\nThe bivariate statistics show a moderate positive correlation (Pearson: 0.343, Spearman: 0.150) between pulse_width and energy. This suggests that as pulse_width increases, energy tends to increase as well, but the relationship is not very strong. We will incorporate this trend in the synthetic data.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the influence of intensity and power on cutoff_energy\nThe bivariate statistics show a strong positive correlation between intensity and cutoff_energy (Pearson: 0.397, Spearman: 0.567) and between power and cutoff_energy (Pearson: 0.584, Spearman: 0.609). This suggests that higher intensity and power values tend to result in higher cutoff_energy values. We will reflect this relationship in the synthetic data.\n\nStep 4: Generate 25 synthetic data points\nBased on the above analysis, here are 25 generated data points that follow the patterns in the original data:\n\n[\n  [\"plastic\", 0.512, 30, 2.331, 3.3, 6.301E+20, 77700000000000, 4.7],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.623, 279, 1.587, 3.3, 4.613E+19, 5689000000000, 4.9],\n  [\"aluminium\", 5.5, 60, 6.8, 15.0, 4.400E+19, 113300000000000, 7.8],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.298, 30, 2.341, 3.3, 6.329E+20, 78050000000000, 4.9],\n  [\"polypropylene\", 0.12, 500, 130.45, 4.458, 1.156E+21, 260900000000000, 47.5],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.845, 279, 2.343, 3.3, 6.808E+19, 8396000000000, 6.0],\n  [\"gold\", 3.8, 475, 2.201, 4.427, 2.087E+19, 4631000000000, 7.9],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.482, 80, 2.395, 3.3, 2.428E+20, 29940000000000, 4.1],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.701, 30, 2.421, 3.3, 6.545E+20, 80720000000000, 5.9],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.612, 279, 1.578, 3.3, 4.586E+19, 5656000000000, 4.7],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.287, 30, 2.333, 3.3, 6.309E+20, 77800000000000, 4.7],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.543, 80, 2.478, 3.3, 2.512E+20, 30980000000000, 6.6],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.398, 463, 2.412, 3.3, 4.224E+19, 5209000000000, 4.3],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.654, 279, 1.568, 3.3, 4.556E+19, 5620000000000, 5.0],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.711, 80, 1.557, 3.3, 1.578E+20, 19460000000000, 5.6],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.342, 30, 2.328, 3.3, 6.293E+20, 77610000000000, 4.3],\n  [\"polystyrene\", 1.4, 500, 132.63, 3.473, 1.939E+21, 265300000000000, 72.5],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.921, 80, 2.299, 3.3, 2.331E+20, 28740000000000, 6.0],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.587, 80, 2.491, 3.3, 2.525E+20, 31140000000000, 6.9],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.751, 30, 2.377, 3.3, 6.427E+20, 79260000000000, 4.6],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.436, 30, 2.332, 3.3, 6.305E+20, 77750000000000, 4.4],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.681, 30, 2.429, 3.3, 6.565E+20, 80970000000000, 6.0],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.519, 80, 2.407, 3.3, 2.440E+20, 30090000000000, 4.2],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.638, 279, 1.592, 3.3, 4.627E+19, 5707000000000, 5.2],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.302, 30, 2.337, 3.3, 6.317E+20, 77910000000000, 4.8]\n]\n\nThis synthetic dataset maintains the general patterns and relationships observed in the original data while introducing some variability within the specified ranges and distributions.",
