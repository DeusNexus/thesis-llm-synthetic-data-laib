    "content": "Here is the step-by-step process to generate 25 new synthetic data points considering the patterns in the dataset:\n\nStep 1: Analyze target_material distribution\nThe most common target material is \"plastic\", appearing in the majority of samples. Other materials like \"aluminium\", \"polypropylene\", \"gold\", and \"polystyrene\" appear less frequently. To generate realistic data, the majority of samples should have \"plastic\" as the target_material, with a few samples of other materials.\n\nStep 2: Examine pulse_width and energy relationship  \nThere is a positive correlation between pulse_width and energy based on the Pearson and Spearman correlations. Samples with higher pulse_width tend to have higher energy values. When generating data, higher pulse_width values should be paired with higher energy values following this trend.\n\nStep 3: Consider intensity, power and cutoff_energy\nIntensity and power have positive correlations with cutoff_energy. Higher intensity and power values tend to result in higher cutoff_energy. The generated samples should reflect this, with higher intensity and power leading to higher cutoff_energy values.\n\nStep 4: Generate target_thickness values\nBased on the univariate stats, the majority of target_thickness values are less than 1.0, with the median at 0.593. A few high outliers exist. When generating data, most target_thickness values should be less than 1.0, with a few larger values.\n\nStep 5: Generate pulse_width and energy pairs\nPulse_width has a large variance, with most values clustered around 30, but some much higher. Energy is positively correlated. To generate realistic pairs, select pulse_width from a distribution mostly around 30 with some high values, and calculate energy using a linear model based on the pulse_width.\n\nStep 6: Generate spot_size values\nThe spot_size distribution is tightly clustered around 3.3 based on the percentiles. Generating mostly 3.3 values with occasional different values would match the data.\n\nStep 7: Generate intensity and power values\nBoth distributions are highly skewed with some extreme outliers. When generating pairs, select mostly values around the medians of 6.22e20 and 7.68e13 respectively, with a rare larger values. Intensity and power are highly correlated, so pairs should maintain a linear relationship.\n\nStep 8: Generate cutoff_energy based on intensity and power\nWith positive correlations, generate cutoff_energy using a linear model with intensity and power as inputs. Select weights to produce a distribution of values mostly less than 10 to match the original distribution.\n\nStep 9: Combine all features into samples \nAggregate the generated values for each feature into complete data samples. Ensure each sample has a value for every feature.\n\nGenerated Samples:\n\nHere are the 25 generated synthetic data points:\n\n[\n  [\"plastic\", 0.612, 30, 2.33, 3.3, 6.30e20, 7.78e13, 4.9], \n  [\"plastic\", 0.288, 30, 2.31, 3.3, 6.22e20, 7.69e13, 4.8],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.734, 279, 3.78, 3.3, 6.79e20, 8.40e13, 6.5],\n  [\"aluminium\", 5.2, 60, 6.8, 15.0, 4.18e19, 1.12e14, 7.6],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.822, 80, 2.40, 3.3, 2.44e20, 3.01e13, 5.1],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.415, 30, 2.32, 3.3, 6.27e20, 7.74e13, 4.7],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.556, 279, 3.64, 3.3, 6.60e20, 8.11e13, 6.1],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.482, 80, 2.38, 3.3, 2.41e20, 2.97e13, 4.9],\n  [\"polypropylene\", 0.15, 500, 140.1, 4.46, 1.25e21, 2.81e14, 51.3],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.904, 279, 3.86, 3.3, 6.89e20, 8.52e13, 6.7],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.329, 30, 2.32, 3.3, 6.26e20, 7.72e13, 4.7],\n  [\"gold\", 3.6, 475, 3.92, 4.43, 2.23e19, 5.02e13, 8.5],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.688, 30, 2.35, 3.3, 6.35e20, 7.84e13, 5.0],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.592, 80, 2.41, 3.3, 2.45e20, 3.02e13, 5.0], \n  [\"plastic\", 0.769, 279, 3.81, 3.3, 6.82e20, 8.44e13, 6.6],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.238, 30, 2.30, 3.3, 6.21e20, 7.66e13, 4.6],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.661, 80, 2.43, 3.3, 2.46e20, 3.04e13, 5.2],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.527, 30, 2.33, 3.3, 6.31e20, 7.79e13, 4.8],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.873, 279, 3.84, 3.3, 6.86e20, 8.48e13, 6.7],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.304, 30, 2.31, 3.3, 6.25e20, 7.71e13, 4.7],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.719, 80, 2.44, 3.3, 2.48e20, 3.06e13, 5.3],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.451, 463, 4.98, 3.3, 4.26e19, 5.26e13, 8.9],\n  [\"polystyrene\", 1.2, 500, 138.7, 3.47, 1.92e21, 2.77e14, 72.5],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.836, 279, 3.82, 3.3, 6.83e20, 8.45e13, 6.6],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.382, 30, 2.32, 3.3, 6.28e20, 7.76e13, 4.7]\n]\n\nThis generated data follows the key patterns in the original data while introducing realistic variation based on the underlying distributions and relationships between features.
