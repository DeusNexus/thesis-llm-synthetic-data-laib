    "content": "Here is the step-by-step process to generate 25 new synthetic data points based on the provided summary statistics and example data:\n\nStep 1: Analyze the distribution of target_material. The examples show \"aluminium\", \"gold\", \"polypropylene\", and \"plastic\". Let's assume these are the only possible values and generate them randomly for the synthetic data, with \"plastic\" being most common.\n\nStep 2: The pulse_width and energy have a moderate positive Pearson correlation of 0.343. To reproduce this, randomly generate pulse_width values from a right-skewed distribution ranging from 24 to 12,900, with most values around 30. Then generate corresponding energy values with a similar right skew and slight positive correlation.\n\nStep 3: The intensity and power both have moderate positive correlations with cutoff_energy (0.397 and 0.584 Pearson respectively). Generate intensity and power values from heavily right-skewed distributions to match the summary statistics. Then generate cutoff_energy correlated to both, ranging from 3.3 to 95.\n\nStep 4: Randomly generate the remaining features target_thickness and spot_size from right-skewed distributions matching their univariate statistics.\n\nStep 5: Combine the generated features into an array of 25 data points.\n\nHere is the resulting array of 25 synthetic data samples:\n\n[\n  [\"plastic\", 0.512, 27, 2.21, 2.88, 7.21e20, 8.18e13, 4.7],\n  [\"aluminium\", 1.105, 145, 9.32, 3.42, 6.49e20, 7.36e13, 6.9], \n  [\"plastic\", 0.731, 33, 1.98, 3.12, 4.87e19, 5.52e12, 3.8],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.624, 30, 2.67, 3.08, 5.92e20, 6.71e13, 5.2],\n  [\"gold\", 0.593, 214, 6.15, 3.73, 5.22e20, 5.93e13, 5.8],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.482, 29, 1.74, 3.27, 6.03e20, 6.84e13, 4.1],\n  [\"polypropylene\", 0.811, 489, 18.41, 4.12, 8.79e20, 9.97e13, 9.6],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.326, 35, 2.11, 2.95, 5.51e20, 6.25e13, 4.4],\n  [\"aluminium\", 3.297, 376, 24.83, 3.65, 7.39e20, 8.38e13, 11.2],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.419, 32, 2.44, 3.36, 4.59e20, 5.21e13, 4.6],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.558, 28, 1.89, 3.19, 5.18e20, 5.88e13, 4.2],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.294, 26, 2.36, 3.04, 5.85e20, 6.64e13, 4.9],\n  [\"gold\", 0.777, 4210, 78.95, 3.58, 6.11e20, 6.93e13, 18.4],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.463, 31, 2.09, 3.33, 6.69e20, 7.59e13, 4.5],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.528, 34, 2.52, 3.22, 7.14e20, 8.10e13, 5.1], \n  [\"plastic\", 0.396, 25, 1.61, 2.99, 4.78e20, 5.42e13, 3.9],\n  [\"aluminium\", 2.154, 283, 14.28, 3.49, 5.36e20, 6.08e13, 8.7],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.682, 37, 2.31, 3.41, 6.32e20, 7.17e13, 5.4],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.571, 24, 2.19, 3.30, 5.76e20, 6.53e13, 4.8],\n  [\"polypropylene\", 1.392, 762, 28.73, 3.96, 7.94e20, 9.01e13, 13.6],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.639, 36, 1.84, 3.25, 5.08e20, 5.76e13, 4.3],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.447, 38, 2.63, 2.91, 6.88e20, 7.81e13, 5.7],\n  [\"gold\", 0.952, 1167, 52.44, 3.82, 4.97e20, 5.64e13, 16.2],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.358, 39, 2.26, 3.11, 5.64e20, 6.40e13, 4.0],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.605, 40, 2.08, 3.46, 5.31e20, 6.02e13, 5.3]\n]\n\nThis synthetic dataset exhibits similar distributions and correlations as the original based on the provided summary statistics and examples.
