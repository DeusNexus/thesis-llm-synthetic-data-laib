For the synthetic data, we will generate mostly plastic target materials with a few other materials.\n\nStep 2: Generate pulse_width and energy values considering their relationship.\nThere is a positive correlation between pulse_width and energy (Pearson correlation of 0.343). We will generate pulse_width values ranging from 30 to 500, with corresponding energy values that are positively correlated.\n\nStep 3: Generate intensity and power values considering their influence on cutoff_energy.\nBoth intensity and power have a positive correlation with cutoff_energy (Pearson correlations of 0.397 and 0.584, respectively). We will generate intensity and power values within the observed ranges and ensure that higher values correspond to higher cutoff_energy values.\n\nStep 4: Generate the remaining features (target_thickness and spot_size) based on their distributions.\nFor target_thickness, we will generate values mostly between 0.3 and 1.0, with a few higher values.
