    "content": "Here is my step-by-step approach to generate 25 new data points based on the observed patterns in the data:\n\n1. Target Material: The most common target materials seem to be \"plastic\", with some samples of \"aluminium\", \"polypropylene\", \"polystyrene\", and \"gold\". I'll generate samples with a mix of these materials, heavily weighted towards \"plastic\".\n\n2. Pulse Width and Energy: There's a moderate positive correlation between pulse width and energy. I'll generate pulse widths ranging from ~30 to ~500 based on the percentiles, and corresponding energy values loosely based on the correlation.\n\n3. Intensity, Power and Cutoff Energy: Intensity and power have moderate positive correlations with cutoff energy. I'll generate a range of intensity and power values, and corresponding cutoff energy values based on these correlations. \n\n4. Other features: For the remaining features (target thickness, spot size), I'll generate values within the typical ranges observed in the univariate statistics.\n\nHere are the 25 generated data points:\n\n[\n  [\"plastic\", 0.58, 35, 2.3, 3.3, 6.1E+20, 7.5E+13, 4.2],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.76, 250, 14, 3.3, 7.2E+20, 8.9E+13, 6.8], \n  [\"aluminium\", 4.2, 45, 5.5, 7.6, 2.5E+20, 1.8E+14, 9.4],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.49, 380, 18, 3.3, 4.6E+19, 5.7E+12, 4.7],\n  [\"polypropylene\", 12, 440, 115, 4.2, 1.1E+21, 2.3E+14, 36],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.81, 40, 2.4, 3.3, 5.9E+20, 7.3E+13, 4.4],\n  [\"gold\", 3.7, 4200, 20, 3.2, 3.9E+19, 4.4E+12, 6.9],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.93, 260, 2.3, 3.3, 6.5E+19, 8.0E+12, 5.1],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.38, 450, 2.3, 3.3, 3.8E+19, 4.7E+12, 4.2],\n  [\"polystyrene\", 0.33, 460, 118, 3.4, 1.7E+21, 2.4E+14, 74],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.55, 50, 2.3, 3.3, 5.7E+20, 7.0E+13, 4.1],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.71, 320, 16, 3.3, 9.4E+20, 1.2E+14, 7.2],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.64, 180, 9, 3.3, 8.3E+20, 1.0E+14, 5.9],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.87, 60, 2.4, 3.3, 6.6E+20, 8.1E+13, 4.6],\n  [\"aluminium\", 4.6, 38, 5.8, 7.8, 2.6E+20, 1.9E+14, 9.7],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.52, 400, 19, 3.3, 5.1E+19, 6.3E+12, 4.8],\n  [\"polypropylene\", 11, 460, 124, 4.3, 1.2E+21, 2.5E+14, 38],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.78, 33, 2.3, 3.3, 6.3E+20, 7.8E+13, 4.3],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.41, 430, 2.3, 3.3, 4.2E+19, 5.2E+12, 4.3],\n  [\"gold\", 3.9, 4400, 21, 3.2, 4.0E+19, 4.6E+12, 7.1],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.96, 240, 2.3, 3.3, 7.1E+19, 8.8E+12, 5.3],\n  [\"polystyrene\", 0.31, 480, 122, 3.5, 1.8E+21, 2.5E+14, 77],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.59, 75, 3.5, 3.3, 5.4E+20, 6.7E+13, 4.6],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.84, 220, 12, 3.3, 7.8E+20, 9.6E+13, 6.4],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.68, 150, 7, 3.3, 7.5E+20, 9.3E+13, 5.5]\n]\n\nThis generated data attempts to mimic key patterns around material types, the pulse width / energy relationship, and the influence of intensity and power on cutoff energy, while varying other features within typical ranges.
