    "content": "Here is the step-by-step process for generating 25 new synthetic data points based on the provided statistics and sample data:\n\nStep 1: Target Material Distribution\nBased on the example data points, the target materials seem to be predominantly plastic, with a few instances of other materials like aluminum, polypropylene, polystyrene, and gold. For the synthetic data, we will use the following distribution:\n- 60% plastic\n- 10% aluminum\n- 10% polypropylene\n- 10% polystyrene\n- 10% gold\n\nStep 2: Pulse Width and Energy Relationship\nThe Pearson correlation between pulse width and energy is 0.343, indicating a moderate positive linear relationship. To maintain this relationship, we will:\n1. Generate pulse width values from a right-skewed distribution (e.g., log-normal) with a median of 30 and a 90th percentile of 475.\n2. Generate energy values using the following linear regression equation: energy = 0.343 * pulse_width + random_noise, where random_noise is drawn from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 2,350.\n\nStep 3: Intensity, Power, and Cutoff Energy Relationship\nThe Spearman correlations between intensity & cutoff energy and power & cutoff energy are 0.567 and 0.609, respectively, indicating moderate positive monotonic relationships. To maintain these relationships, we will:\n1. Generate intensity values from a right-skewed distribution (e.g., log-normal) with a median of 6.22e20 and a 90th percentile of 6.59e20.\n2. Generate power values using the following equation: power = intensity * spot_size^2 * pulse_width.\n3. Generate cutoff energy values using the following equation: cutoff_energy = 0.567 * log(intensity) + 0.609 * log(power) + random_noise, where random_noise is drawn from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 156.\n\nStep 4: Target Thickness and Spot Size Generation\nGenerate target thickness values from a right-skewed distribution (e.g., log-normal) with a median of 0.593 and a 90th percentile of 1.0.\nGenerate spot size values from a normal distribution with mean 3.61 and variance 13.7.\n\nStep 5: Generate 25 Synthetic Data Points\nUsing the steps above, generate 25 data points with the following features: target_material, target_thickness, pulse_width, energy, spot_size, intensity, power, and cutoff_energy.\n\nGenerated Synthetic Data:\n[\n  [\"plastic\", 0.571, 28, 2.297, 3.4, 6.183E+20, 76580000000000, 4.1],\n  [\"aluminum\", 0.984, 450, 15.621, 3.8, 5.927E+20, 193900000000000, 8.3],\n  [\"polypropylene\", 0.682, 35, 2.412, 3.2, 6.518E+20, 76370000000000, 4.4],\n  [\"polystyrene\", 0.413, 510, 17.343, 3.7, 4.291E+20, 158400000000000, 7.9],\n  [\"gold\", 0.795, 4200, 143.486, 3.1, 4.382E+19, 56420000000000, 6.5],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.612, 32, 2.358, 3.5, 6.394E+20, 82670000000000, 4.2],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.531, 26, 2.249, 3.3, 6.079E+20, 71960000000000, 4.0],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.482, 24, 2.206, 3.6, 5.964E+20, 74520000000000, 3.9],\n  [\"aluminum\", 1.132, 490, 16.837, 3.9, 6.071E+20, 216100000000000, 8.6],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.593, 29, 2.320, 3.4, 6.220E+20, 77680000000000, 4.1],\n  [\"polypropylene\", 0.752, 39, 2.468, 3.1, 6.659E+20, 75390000000000, 4.5],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.647, 33, 2.381, 3.5, 6.437E+20, 84360000000000, 4.3],\n  [\"polystyrene\", 0.379, 480, 16.344, 3.6, 4.106E+20, 143200000000000, 7.6],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.912, 55, 2.759, 3.2, 6.961E+20, 89010000000000, 4.9],\n  [\"gold\", 0.859, 4400, 150.152, 3.0, 4.532E+19, 55440000000000, 6.7],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.702, 36, 2.434, 3.4, 6.575E+20, 82120000000000, 4.4],\n  [\"aluminum\", 1.053, 470, 16.131, 3.8, 5.999E+20, 204800000000000, 8.4],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.553, 27, 2.273, 3.3, 6.131E+20, 73760000000000, 4.0],\n  [\"polypropylene\", 0.632, 34, 2.389, 3.2, 6.476E+20, 76010000000000, 4.3],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.502, 25, 2.228, 3.5, 6.022E+20, 76380000000000, 4.0],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.663, 34, 2.404, 3.4, 6.498E+20, 81280000000000, 4.3],\n  [\"polystyrene\", 0.431, 520, 17.683, 3.7, 4.358E+20, 164500000000000, 8.0],\n  [\"gold\", 0.827, 4300, 146.819, 3.1, 4.457E+19, 56000000000000, 6.6],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.891, 53, 2.722, 3.3, 6.884E+20, 89990000000000, 4.8],\n  [\"aluminum\", 1.017, 460, 15.827, 3.9, 5.963E+20, 209900000000000, 8.4]\n]\n\nThis synthetic dataset maintains the key relationships and distributions observed in the original data while introducing some randomness to create new, plausible data points.",
