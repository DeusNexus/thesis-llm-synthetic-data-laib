Analyze target_material distribution:\n   - No specific statistics given, but examples show \"aluminium\", \"gold\", \"polypropylene\", \"plastic\" \n   - Most examples are \"plastic\", so I'll generate more \"plastic\" samples\n\n2. Analyze pulse_width and energy relationship:\n   - Pearson correlation of 0.343 indicates a moderate positive linear relationship\n   - I'll generate pulse_width and energy values that loosely follow this positive correlation\n\n3.
