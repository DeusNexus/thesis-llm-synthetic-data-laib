For the generated data, we will primarily use \"plastic\" with a few samples of the other materials.\n\nStep 2: Examine the relationship between pulse_width and energy\nThere appears to be a moderate positive correlation between pulse_width and energy. For the generated data, we will create samples where higher pulse_width values generally correspond to higher energy values, with some variability.\n\nStep 3: Consider the influence of intensity and power on cutoff_energy\nThe data suggests that higher intensity and power values tend to result in higher cutoff_energy values. We will generate samples where higher intensity and power values generally lead to higher cutoff_energy values, with some randomness.\n\nStep 4: Generate target_thickness, spot_size, and other features\nFor target_thickness, we will generate values primarily between 0.2 and 1.0, with a few samples outside this range. Spot_size will be mostly 3.3, with occasional other values.
