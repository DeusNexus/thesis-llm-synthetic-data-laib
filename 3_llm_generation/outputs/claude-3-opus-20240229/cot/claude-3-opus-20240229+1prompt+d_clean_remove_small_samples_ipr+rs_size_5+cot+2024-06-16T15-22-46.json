Let's assume the following distribution:\n- 40% plastic\n- 30% aluminium \n- 20% gold\n- 10% polypropylene\n\nStep 2: Pulse Width and Energy Relationship\nThe Pearson correlation between pulse width and energy is 0.343, indicating a weak positive linear relationship. To generate pulse width and energy pairs:\n1. Randomly generate pulse widths using the pulse width statistics\n2. For each pulse width, calculate the corresponding energy using the regression equation: energy = 0.343 * (pulse_width - mean_pulse_width) / std_pulse_width * std_energy + mean_energy\n\nStep 3: Intensity, Power, and Cutoff Energy Relationship\nIntensity and power have Pearson correlations of 0.397 and 0.584 with energy, respectively, indicating positive linear relationships. Cutoff energy has a stronger correlation of 0.672 with energy.\n1. Use the generated energy values from Step 2\n2. Calculate intensity and power using their respective regression equations:\n   - intensity = 0.397 * (energy - mean_energy) / std_energy * std_intensity + mean_intensity\n   - power = 0.584 * (energy - mean_energy) / std_energy * std_power + mean_power\n3. Calculate cutoff energy using its regression equation:\n   - cutoff_energy = 0.672 * (energy - mean_energy) / std_energy * std_cutoff_energy + mean_cutoff_energy\n\nStep 4: Other Feature Generation\nFor the remaining features (target thickness and spot size), generate random values based on their respective univariate statistics.\n\nStep 5: Putting it all together\nGenerate 25 samples using the steps above.
