Other materials include \"aluminium\", \"polypropylene\", \"polystyrene\", and \"gold\". I'll generate mostly plastic samples with a few of the other materials.\n\nStep 2: Consider pulse_width and energy relationship  \nThe Pearson correlation of 0.343 indicates a moderate positive linear relationship between pulse_width and energy.

I'll generate intensity and power values skewed towards the higher end and scale cutoff_energy proportionally.\n\nStep 4: Generate remaining features\nFor the other features like target_thickness and spot_size, I'll generate values roughly normally distributed between their min and max.\n\nStep 5: Create 25 synthetic data points\n\nHere is the array of 25 generated samples:\n\n[\n  [\"plastic\", 0.581, 279, 2.507, 3.426, 6.185E+20, 76390000000000, 4.7], \n  [\"polypropylene\", 1.334, 412, 7.102, 3.953, 7.315E+20, 172400000000000, 8.1],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.612, 30, 2.207, 3.193, 5.892E+20, 72680000000000, 4.2],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.523, 138, 2.074, 3.471, 5.023E+20, 61940000000000, 3.9],\n  [\"gold\", 0.482, 851, 2.913, 3.107, 1.203E+20, 34220000000000, 7.6],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.719, 30, 1.931, 3.618, 6.341E+20, 78230000000000, 5.1],\n  [\"aluminium\", 0.804, 351, 3.269, 4.285, 4.706E+20, 93020000000000, 6.4],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.556, 105, 2.285, 2.874, 5.419E+20, 66830000000000, 4.6],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.498, 89, 1.859, 3.392, 6.027E+20, 74320000000000, 3.8],\n  [\"polystyrene\", 0.683, 463, 11.418, 3.014, 9.174E+20, 246500000000000, 10.5],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.774, 242, 2.631, 2.793, 5.736E+20, 70760000000000, 5.2], \n  [\"plastic\", 0.462, 56, 2.153, 3.527, 6.509E+20, 80290000000000, 4.1],\n  [\"aluminium\", 1.197, 279, 4.185, 5.136, 3.842E+20, 149700000000000, 6.7],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.891, 197, 2.413, 3.083, 5.295E+20, 65310000000000, 4.9],\n  [\"polypropylene\", 0.966, 538, 8.627, 3.741, 8.059E+20, 160300000000000, 8.8],  \n  [\"plastic\", 0.427, 30, 1.784, 3.659, 6.631E+20, 81800000000000, 3.6],\n  [\"gold\", 0.593, 1253, 3.482, 2.965, 9.417E+19, 27690000000000, 8.3],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.653, 172, 2.348, 2.932, 5.604E+20, 69120000000000, 4.8],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.841, 215, 2.572, 3.248, 5.471E+20, 67480000000000, 5.0],  \n  [\"plastic\", 0.536, 71, 2.092, 3.561, 6.243E+20, 77010000000000, 4.0],\n  [\"aluminium\", 0.927, 314, 3.618, 4.692, 4.279E+20, 115400000000000, 6.5], \n  [\"polystyrene\", 0.759, 500, 12.305, 3.176, 9.728E+20, 246100000000000, 11.3],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.483, 46, 1.997, 3.736, 6.753E+20, 83290000000000, 3.7],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.628, 153, 2.217, 3.314, 5.159E+20, 63630000000000, 4.5],\n  [\"gold\", 0.517, 1047, 3.106, 3.029, 1.073E+20, 29610000000000, 7.9]\n]\n\nThis synthetic dataset maintains the key characteristics and relationships observed in the original data while introducing realistic variation.
