    "content": "Here is the step-by-step process to generate 25 synthetic data points based on the provided statistics and example data:\n\nStep 1: Analyze target_material distribution\nFrom the example data, the most common target materials appear to be \"plastic\", with a few instances of \"aluminium\", \"polypropylene\", \"gold\", and \"polystyrene\". For the synthetic data, we will generate samples with the following distribution:\n- 20 samples with \"plastic\"\n- 1 sample each with \"aluminium\", \"polypropylene\", \"gold\", \"polystyrene\", and a new material \"copper\"\n\nStep 2: Consider the relationship between pulse_width and energy\nThe Pearson correlation between pulse_width and energy is 0.343, indicating a moderate positive linear relationship. We will generate pulse_width values from a right-skewed distribution (e.g., exponential) and then calculate the corresponding energy values using a linear regression model with added Gaussian noise.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the influence of intensity and power on cutoff_energy\nThe Pearson correlations of intensity and power with cutoff_energy are 0.397 and 0.584, respectively. This suggests that both intensity and power have a moderate positive linear relationship with cutoff_energy. We will generate intensity and power values from a right-skewed distribution (e.g., log-normal) and then calculate the corresponding cutoff_energy values using a multiple linear regression model with added Gaussian noise.\n\nStep 4: Generate the remaining features\nFor the remaining features (target_thickness and spot_size), we will generate values from distributions that match their respective univariate statistics, such as log-normal for target_thickness and normal for spot_size.\n\nStep 5: Generate the synthetic data points\nHere are the 25 generated samples:\n\n[\n  [\"plastic\", 0.512, 45, 2.401, 3.298, 6.112E+20, 7.534E+13, 4.912],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.743, 312, 2.811, 3.305, 6.798E+19, 8.385E+12, 5.432],\n  [\"aluminium\", 5.623, 67, 6.834, 14.872, 4.398E+19, 1.120E+14, 7.845],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.298, 28, 2.298, 3.301, 6.397E+20, 7.890E+13, 4.723],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.687, 254, 2.512, 3.297, 7.021E+19, 8.663E+12, 5.289],\n  [\"polypropylene\", 0.112, 487, 131.456, 4.412, 1.187E+21, 2.663E+14, 47.934],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.331, 32, 2.374, 3.304, 6.187E+20, 7.631E+13, 4.623],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.594, 92, 2.387, 3.296, 2.198E+20, 2.710E+13, 4.512],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.542, 74, 2.314, 3.302, 2.601E+20, 3.208E+13, 4.398],\n  [\"gold\", 3.897, 462, 2.199, 4.385, 2.087E+19, 4.639E+12, 7.967],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.881, 287, 2.845, 3.306, 6.621E+19, 8.168E+12, 5.987],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.783, 268, 2.643, 3.299, 7.012E+19, 8.653E+12, 5.412],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.132, 27, 2.213, 3.295, 6.274E+20, 7.739E+13, 4.398],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.614, 261, 2.542, 3.304, 4.812E+19, 5.936E+12, 4.712],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.284, 33, 2.389, 3.302, 6.198E+20, 7.645E+13, 4.801],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.289, 29, 2.276, 3.297, 6.387E+20, 7.878E+13, 3.845],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.412, 36, 2.398, 3.305, 6.087E+20, 7.508E+13, 4.289],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.712, 42, 2.512, 3.301, 6.213E+20, 7.663E+13, 4.512],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.659, 38, 2.587, 3.298, 6.398E+20, 7.891E+13, 6.012],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.698, 88, 1.623, 3.304, 1.498E+20, 1.848E+13, 5.398],\n  [\"polystyrene\", 1.432, 487, 131.456, 3.429, 1.954E+21, 2.663E+14, 73.456],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.946, 93, 2.398, 3.297, 2.211E+20, 2.727E+13, 6.012],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.521, 76, 2.314, 3.305, 2.514E+20, 3.101E+13, 4.123],\n  [\"copper\", 2.341, 378, 3.012, 5.792, 8.932E+19, 1.102E+13, 6.845],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.369, 451, 2.376, 3.298, 4.312E+19, 5.320E+12, 4.298]\n]",
