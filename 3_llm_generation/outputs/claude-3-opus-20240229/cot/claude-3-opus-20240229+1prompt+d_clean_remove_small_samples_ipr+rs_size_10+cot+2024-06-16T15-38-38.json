    "content": "Here is the step-by-step process for generating 25 new synthetic data points based on the provided statistics and example data:\n\nStep 1: Analyze target_material distribution\nThe example data suggests the following approximate distribution for target_material:\n- plastic: 60% \n- aluminium: 10%\n- polypropylene: 10% \n- polystyrene: 10%\n- gold: 10%\n\nStep 2: Consider the relationship between pulse_width and energy\nThe positive Pearson and Spearman correlations (0.343 and 0.150) indicate a weak to moderate positive relationship. To mimic this, energy values will be loosely based on the corresponding pulse_width.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the influence of intensity and power on cutoff_energy\nThe positive Pearson and Spearman correlations (0.672 and 0.563 for energy and cutoff_energy, 0.397 and 0.567 for intensity and energy, 0.584 and 0.609 for power and energy) suggest that higher intensity and power values generally correspond to higher cutoff_energy.
