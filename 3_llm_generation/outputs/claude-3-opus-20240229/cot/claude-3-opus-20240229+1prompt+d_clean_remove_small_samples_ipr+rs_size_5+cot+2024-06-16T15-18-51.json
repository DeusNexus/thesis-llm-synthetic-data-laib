We will generate synthetic data points with these materials in a similar proportion.\n\nStep 2: Examine the relationship between pulse_width and energy\nThe Pearson correlation between pulse_width and energy is 0.343, indicating a moderate positive linear relationship. We will generate pulse_width and energy values that maintain this correlation.\n\nStep 3: Study the influence of intensity and power on cutoff_energy\nThe Pearson correlations between intensity and cutoff_energy (0.397) and power and cutoff_energy (0.584) suggest that higher intensity and power values tend to result in higher cutoff_energy.
