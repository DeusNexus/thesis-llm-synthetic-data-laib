    "content": "Here is the step-by-step process to generate 25 new synthetic data points based on the provided statistics and examples:\n\nStep 1: Analyze target_material distribution\nThe examples show the majority of data points have \"plastic\" as the target material, with a few instances of \"aluminium\", \"gold\", \"polypropylene\" and \"polystyrene\". For the synthetic data, we will assign:\n- 80% of samples as \"plastic\" (20 samples)\n- 5% each for \"aluminium\", \"gold\", \"polypropylene\" and \"polystyrene\" (1 sample each)\n\nStep 2: Generate pulse_width and energy\nThe statistics show a positive correlation between pulse_width and energy. We'll use the median, 10th and 90th percentile values to generate data in the typical ranges:\n- 60% of data between 10th and 90th percentile (15 samples)\n- 20% below 10th percentile and 20% above 90th percentile (5 samples each)\n\nStep 3: Generate intensity and power\nIntensity and power are positively correlated with energy. We'll use a similar approach as step 2, generating values based on the 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles.\n\nStep 4: Generate cutoff_energy \nCutoff_energy is positively correlated with energy, intensity and power. We'll generate values proportional to the energy of each sample.\n\nStep 5: Generate remaining features\n- target_thickness: Randomly sample between min and max values\n- spot_size: Assign the median value of 3.3 to most samples, with a few random outliers\n\nFinal generated synthetic data:\n\n[\n  [\"plastic\", 0.684, 30, 1.98, 3.3, 5.34e20, 6.60e13, 5.1],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.372, 279, 1.89, 3.3, 5.50e19, 6.78e12, 4.9], \n  [\"plastic\", 0.811, 475, 8.54, 3.3, 6.22e20, 1.80e13, 10.2],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.529, 30, 2.12, 3.3, 5.72e20, 7.06e13, 5.4],\n  [\"aluminium\", 3.2, 1500, 198.3, 60.0, 3.27e18, 1.32e14, 11.5],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.936, 30, 2.26, 3.3, 6.11e20, 7.54e13, 5.7],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.428, 24, 1.61, 3.3, 4.36e20, 6.70e13, 4.4],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.775, 279, 2.09, 3.3, 6.07e19, 7.49e12, 5.3],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.316, 30, 1.72, 3.103, 4.66e20, 5.74e13, 4.6],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.653, 12900, 562.1, 3.3, 6.59e20, 4.35e13, 93.8],\n  [\"gold\", 2.1, 500, 43.8, 2.127, 1.71e21, 8.76e13, 25.6], \n  [\"plastic\", 0.721, 279, 2.47, 2.13, 7.18e19, 8.86e12, 6.0],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.592, 30, 2.31, 3.3, 6.25e20, 7.71e13, 5.6],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.483, 279, 1.96, 3.3, 5.70e19, 7.03e12, 5.0],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.851, 463, 6.37, 3.3, 1.12e20, 1.38e13, 8.6],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.414, 30, 1.83, 3.3, 4.94e20, 6.10e13, 4.7],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.629, 30, 2.54, 3.3, 6.87e20, 8.47e13, 6.1],  \n  [\"polypropylene\", 0.912, 500, 122.4, 4.406, 1.11e21, 2.45e14, 47.2],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.558, 187, 1.73, 3.3, 7.49e19, 9.24e12, 4.6],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.743, 279, 2.22, 3.3, 6.45e19, 7.96e12, 5.5],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.826, 463, 4.19, 3.3, 7.34e19, 9.05e12, 7.0],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.497, 30, 2.07, 3.3, 5.60e20, 6.90e13, 5.2],\n  [\"polystyrene\", 0.219, 500, 152.1, 3.103, 2.79e21, 3.04e14, 62.3],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.981, 30, 2.39, 3.3, 6.45e20, 7.96e13, 5.8], \n  [\"plastic\", 0.602, 80, 1.67, 3.3, 1.70e20, 2.09e13, 4.5]\n]\n\nThis generates a realistic synthetic dataset that follows the patterns and relationships observed in the provided statistics and example data points.
