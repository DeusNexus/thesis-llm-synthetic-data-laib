I'll generate data points with a similar distribution.\n\nStep 2: Consider the relationship between pulse_width and energy\nThe Pearson correlation between pulse_width and energy is 0.343, indicating a weak positive linear relationship. I'll generate pulse_width values that are positively correlated with energy, but with some noise.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the influence of intensity and power on cutoff_energy\nThe Pearson correlations between intensity and cutoff_energy (0.397) and between power and cutoff_energy (0.584) suggest moderate positive linear relationships. I'll generate intensity and power values that are positively correlated with cutoff_energy, with some noise.\n\nStep 4: Generate target_thickness values\nBased on the univariate statistics, I'll generate target_thickness values that are right-skewed, with a median around 0.593 and a maximum of 125.\n\nStep 5: Generate spot_size values\nThe spot_size values seem to be mostly concentrated around 3.3, with a few larger values. I'll generate spot_size values that are mostly close to 3.3, with occasional larger values.\n\nStep 6: Generate the final 25 data points\nI've generated 25 new data points based on the patterns and relationships observed in the original data:\n\n[\n  [\"plastic\", 0.712, 35, 2.501, 3.3, 6.601E+20, 71430000000000, 4.2],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.589, 42, 2.398, 3.3, 6.312E+20, 57140000000000, 3.9],\n  [\"aluminium\", 4.2, 38, 5.4, 7.2, 2.512E+20, 142100000000000, 9.1],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.823, 29, 2.412, 3.3, 6.398E+20, 82980000000000, 4.1],\n  [\"polypropylene\", 9.1, 480, 129.12, 4.201, 1.198E+21, 270100000000000, 38.2],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.331, 452, 2.358, 3.3, 4.089E+19, 5198000000000, 4.3],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.778, 34, 2.387, 3.3, 6.412E+20, 70120000000000, 4.0],\n  [\"plastic\", 1.012, 31, 2.319, 3.3, 6.199E+20, 74510000000000, 6.0],\n  [\"gold\", 3.7, 4400, 21.123, 3.198, 4.012E+19, 4800000000000, 6.9],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.412, 439, 2.362, 3.3, 4.101E+19, 5389000000000, 4.3],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.889, 268, 2.351, 3.3, 6.799E+19, 8789000000000, 5.2],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.305, 33, 2.311, 3.3, 6.212E+20, 70120000000000, 4.3],\n  [\"polystyrene\", 0.4, 520, 131.01, 3.512, 1.901E+21, 251200000000000, 82.3],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.623, 39, 2.391, 3.3, 6.487E+20, 61230000000000, 3.8],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.798, 32, 2.402, 3.3, 6.512E+20, 75010000000000, 4.1],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.489, 41, 2.378, 3.3, 6.398E+20, 58120000000000, 3.9],\n  [\"aluminium\", 4.8, 33, 5.8, 7.8, 2.699E+20, 175800000000000, 9.8],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.901, 301, 2.367, 3.3, 6.912E+19, 7890000000000, 5.5],  \n  [\"plastic\", 0.312, 28, 2.322, 3.3, 6.298E+20, 82760000000000, 4.5],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.687, 37, 2.412, 3.3, 6.576E+20, 64890000000000, 4.0],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.598, 40, 2.389, 3.3, 6.398E+20, 59720000000000, 3.9],\n  [\"polypropylene\", 9.8, 510, 135.01, 4.412, 1.267E+21, 264700000000000, 41.2],\n  [\"plastic\", 1.023, 27, 2.332, 3.3, 6.312E+20, 86450000000000, 6.1], \n  [\"plastic\", 0.399, 472, 2.369, 3.3, 4.198E+19, 5012000000000, 4.4],\n  [\"plastic\", 0.803, 33, 2.398, 3.3, 6.487E+20, 72720000000000, 4.1]\n]\n\nThe generated data points follow the patterns and relationships observed in the original data, while introducing some variation to create realistic synthetic samples.",
