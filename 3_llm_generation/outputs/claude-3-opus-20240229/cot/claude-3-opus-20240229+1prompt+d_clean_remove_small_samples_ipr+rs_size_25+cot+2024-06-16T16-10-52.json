Other materials include aluminium, polypropylene, gold, and polystyrene. I'll generate mostly plastic samples with a few of the other materials mixed in.\n\nStep 2: Consider relationship between pulse_width and energy\nThere is a positive correlation between pulse_width and energy, with a Pearson correlation of 0.343. I'll generate pulse_width and energy pairs that loosely follow this trend, with higher pulse_widths associated with higher energies on average.\n\nStep 3: Look at influence of intensity and power on cutoff_energy \nBoth intensity and power have positive correlations with cutoff_energy (0.397 and 0.584 Pearson correlations respectively). I'll tend to generate higher cutoff_energies when intensity and power are higher.\n\nStep 4: Generate 25 data points following above patterns\nI'll create mostly plastic examples, with pulse_width and energy, and intensity, power, and cutoff_energy loosely following the observed relationships.
