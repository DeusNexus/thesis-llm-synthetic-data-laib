    "content": "\nTo generate 25 new data points based on the patterns in the given dataset, we will focus on the following features: target_material, target_thickness, pulse_width, energy, spot_size, intensity, power, and cutoff_energy. We will also consider the relationships between these features to create a diverse set of samples that capture the underlying patterns in the data.\n\n1. Target Material:\nWe will select 5 different target materials: plastic, aluminium, gold, polypropylene, and polystyrene. Each material has its own unique properties that affect the ion beam's performance. For example, plastic targets have a lower density than aluminium targets, which affects the ion beam's penetration depth.\n2. Target Thickness:\nWe will select target thicknesses based on the distribution of the given dataset. We can see that the median target thickness is 0.593, and the mean is 1.02. We will select target thicknesses between 0.273 (10th percentile) and 1.0 (mean).\n3. Pulse Width:\nWe will select pulse widths based on the distribution of the given dataset. We can see that the median pulse width is 30, and the mean is 291. We will select pulse widths between 24 (25th percentile) and 12,900 (90th percentile).\n4. Energy:\nWe will select energies based on the distribution of the given dataset. We can see that the median energy is 2.35, and the mean is 13.9. We will select energies between 0.302 (10th percentile) and 1,000 (90th percentile).\n5. Spot Size:\nWe will select spot sizes based on the distribution of the given dataset. We can see that the median spot size is 3.3, and the mean is 3.61. We will select spot sizes between 2.13 (10th percentile) and 60 (90th percentile).\n6. Intensity:\nWe will select intensities based on the distribution of the given dataset. We can see that the median intensity is 6.83e19, and the mean is 5.10e20. We will select intensities between 4.53e19 (10th percentile) and 5.59e21 (90th percentile).\n7. Power:\nWe will select powers based on the distribution of the given dataset. We can see that the median power is 7.68e13, and the mean is 6.23e13. We will select powers between 5.59e12 (10th percentile) and 3.83e14 (90th percentile).\n8. Cutoff Energy:\nWe will select cutoff energies based on the distribution of the given dataset. We can see that the median cutoff energy is 4.8, and the mean is 8.64. We will select cutoff energies between 3.3 (10th percentile) and 95 (90th percentile).\n\nBased on these patterns, we can generate 25 new data points as follows:\n\narray = [\n    ['plastic', 0.273, 30, 2.304, 3.3, 6.184E+20, 79790000000000, 4.0],\n    ['aluminium', 5.0, 30, 6.0, 8.0, 2.759E+20, 200000000000000, 10.0],\n    ['polypropylene', 10.0, 500, 132.03, 4.348, 1.233E+21, 264100000000000, 40.0],\n    ['polystyrene', 0.3, 500, 128.79, 3.495, 1.862E+21, 257600000000000, 80.0],\n    ['plastic', 0.769, 30, 2.4, 3.3, 6.853E+20, 80010000000000, 5.4],\n    ['gold', 4.0, 4600, 22.275, 3.202, 4.170E+19, 4842000000000, 7.2],\n    ['plastic', 0.913, 279, 2.358, 3.3, 6.853E+20, 84520000000000, 5.4],\n    ['plastic', 0.998, 30, 2.327, 3.3, 6.288E+20, 77560000000000, 6.2],\n    ['plastic', 0.44, 463, 2.371, 3.3, 4.153E+19, 5121000000000, 4.4],\n    ['plastic', 0.294, 30, 2.319, 3.3, 6.266E+20, 77280000000000, 4.4],\n    ['aluminium', 5.5, 30, 6.5, 8.5, 2.917E+20, 200000000000000, 11.0],\n    ['polypropylene', 10.5, 500, 134.06, 4.586, 1.307E+21, 264100000000000, 42.0],\n    ['plastic', 0.827, 30, 2.449, 3.3, 7.025E+20, 80010000000000, 5.6],\n    ['gold', 4.5, 4600, 23.234, 3.354, 4.279E+19, 4842000000000, 7.5],\n    ['plastic', 0.953, 279, 2.396, 3.3, 6.922E+20, 84520000000000, 5.8],\n    ['plastic', 0.991, 30, 2.355, 3.3, 6.235E+20, 77560000000000, 6.1],\n    ['plastic', 0.417, 463, 2.387, 3.3, 4.098E+19, 5121000000000, 4.2],\n    ['plastic', 0.27, 30, 2.326, 3.3, 6.197E+20, 77280000000000, 4.3],\n    ['aluminium', 5.9, 30, 6.9, 8.9, 3.012E+20, 20000000000000, 12.0],\n    ['plastic', 0.743, 30, 2.425, 3.3, 6.593E+20, 800100000000, 5.7],\n    ['gold', 4.9, 4600, 24.142, 3.462, 1.313E+21, 48420000000, 7.3],\n    ['plastic', 0.549, 30, 2.493, 3.3, 6.343E+20, 77280000000000000000000000000000000",
