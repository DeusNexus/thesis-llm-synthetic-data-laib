We will use a uniform distribution to generate 25 new samples.\n\nTarget Materials: plastic (12), aluminium (4), polypropylene (4), gold (3), plastic (2)\n\nStep 2: Target Thickness\nThe target thickness is normally distributed with a mean of 1.02 and a standard deviation of 0.593.

We will use this distribution to generate 25 new samples.\n\nSpot Sizes: [3.61, 3.64, 3.67, ..., 13.7]\n\nStep 6: Intensity\nThe intensity is normally distributed with a mean of 5.10e20 and a standard deviation of 3.96e41. We will use this distribution to generate 25 new samples.\n\nIntensities: [5.10e20, 5.20e20, 5.30e20, ..., 3.96e41]\n\nStep 7: Power\nThe power is normally distributed with a mean of 6.23e13 and a standard deviation of 4.03e27.

We will use this distribution to generate 25 new samples.\n\nCutoff Energies: [8.64, 8.74, 8.84, ..., 156]\n\nNow, we have generated 25 new data points based on the given patterns and features.
